<p>Long time readers will know that I bloody love a Gaussian process. I wrote an <em>extremely detailed</em> post on the <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html">various ways to define Gaussian processes</a>. And I did not do that because I just love inflicting Hilbert spaces on people. In fact, the only reason that I ever went beyond the standard operational definition of GPs that most people live their whole lives using is that I needed to.</p>
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>The first time was when I needed to understand approximation properties of a certain class of GPs. <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-24-getting-into-the-subspace/getting-into-the-subspace.html">I wrote a post about it</a>. It’s intense<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>The second time that I really needed to dive into their arcana and apocrypha<sup>2</sup> was when I foolishly asked the question <em>can we compute PC priors for Gaussian processes?</em>.</p>
<p>The answer was yes. But it’s a bit tricky.</p>
<p>So today I’m going to walk you through the ideas. There’s no real need to read the GP post before reading the first half of this one<sup>3</sup>, but it would be immensely useful to have at least glanced at the <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-08-29-priors4/priors4.html">post on PC priors</a>.</p>
<p>This post is <em>very</em> long, but that’s mostly because it tries to be reasonably self-contained. In particular, if you only care about the <a href="https://youtu.be/Z2HwloXqo_U?t=223">fat stuff</a>, you really only need to read the first part. After that there’s a long introduction to the theory of stationary Gaussian processes. All of this stuff is standard, but it’s hard to find collected in one place all of the things that I need to derive the PC prior. The third part actually derives the PC prior using a great deal of methods from the previous part.</p>
<section id="part-1-how-do-you-put-a-prior-on-parameters-of-a-gaussian-process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-1-how-do-you-put-a-prior-on-parameters-of-a-gaussian-process">Part 1: How do you put a prior on parameters of a Gaussian process?</h2>
<p>We are in the situation where we have a model that looks something like this<sup>4</sup> <sup>5</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ay_i%20%5Cmid%20%5Cbeta,%20u,%20%5Ctheta%20&amp;%5Csim%20p(y_i%20%5Cmid%20%5Cbeta,%20u,%20%5Cphi)%20%5C%5C%0Au(%5Ccdot)%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta%20&amp;%5Csim%20GP(0,%20c_%5Ctheta)%20%5C%5C%0A%5Cbeta,%20%5Cphi%20&amp;%5Csim%20p(%5Cbeta,%5Cphi),%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_%5Ctheta(%5Ccdot,%5Ccdot)"> is a covariance function with parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> and we need to specify a joint prior on the GP parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta">.</p>
<p>The simplest case of this would be GP regression, but a key thing here is that, in general, the structure (or functional form) of the priors on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> probably shouldn’t be too tightly tied to the specific likelihood. Why do I say that? Well the <em>scaling</em> of a GP should depend on information about the likelihood, but it’s less clear that anything else in the prior needs to know about the likelihood.</p>
<p>Now this view is predicated on us wanting to make an informative prior. In some very special cases, people with too much time on their hands have derived reference priors for specific models involving GPs. These priors care <em>deeply</em> about which likelihood you use. In fact, if you use them with a different model<sup>6</sup>, you may not end up with a proper<sup>7</sup> posterior. We will talk about those later.</p>
<p>To start, let’s look at the simplest way to build a PC prior. We will then talk about why this is not a good idea.</p>
<section id="a-first-crack-at-a-pc-prior" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-first-crack-at-a-pc-prior">A first crack at a PC prior</h3>
<p>As always, the best place to start is the simplest possible option. There’s always a hope<sup>8</sup> that we won’t need to pull out the big guns.</p>
<p>So what is the simplest solution? Well it’s to treat a GP as just a specific multivariate Gaussian distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Au%20%5Csim%20GP(0,%20%5Csigma%5E2R(%5Ctheta)),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R(%5Ctheta)"> is a correlation matrix.</p>
<p>The nice thing about a multivariate Gaussian is that we have a clean expression for its Kullback-Leibler divergence. Wikipedia tells us that for an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-dimensional multivariate Gaussian <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A2%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(N(0,%20%5CSigma)%20%7C%7C%20N(0,%20%5CSigma_0))%20=%20%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D%5Cleft(%5CSigma_0%5E%7B-1%7D%5CSigma%5Cright)%20+%20%5Clog%20%5Cdet%20%5CSigma_0%20-%20%5Clog%20%5Cdet%20%5CSigma-%20n.%0A"> To build a PC prior we need to consider a base model. That’s tricky in generality, but as we’ve assumed that the covariance matrix can be decomposed into the variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2"> and a correlation matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R(%5Ctheta)">, we can at least specify an easy base model for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">. As always, the simplest model is one with no GP in it, which corresponds to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_%5Ctext%7Bbase%7D%20=%200">. From here, we can follow the usual steps to specify the PC prior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Csigma)%20=%20%5Clambda%20e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%20%5Csigma%7D,%0A"> where we choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%20%5Clog(%5Calpha)/U"> for some upper bound <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U%3E0"> and some tail probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%3C%5Calpha%3C1"> so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(%5Ctheta%20%3E%20U)%20=%20%5Calpha.%0A"> The specific choice of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U"> will depend on the context. For instance, if it’s logistic regression we probably want something like<sup>9</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U=1">. If we have a GP on the log-mean of a Poisson distribution, then we probably want <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U%20%3C%2021.5"> if you want the <em>mean</em> of the Poisson distribution to be less than the maximum integer<sup>10</sup> in R. In most data, you’re gonna want<sup>11</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U%5Cll%205">. If the GP is on the mean of a normal distribution, the choice of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U"> will depend on the context and scaling of the data.</p>
<p>Without more assumptions about the form of the covariance function, it is impossible to choose a base model for the other parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta">.</p>
<p>That said, there is one special case that’s important: the case where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20=%20%5Cell"> is a single parameter controlling the intrinsic length scale, that is the distance at which the correlation between two points <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> units apart is approximately zero. The larger <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> is, the more correlated observations of the GP are and, hence, the less wiggly its realisation is. On the other hand, as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Crightarrow%200">, the observations GP often behaves like realisations from an iid Gaussian and the GP becomes<sup>12</sup> wilder and wilder.</p>
<p>This suggests that a good base model for the length-scale parameter would be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_0%20=%20%5Cinfty">. We note that if both the base model and the alternative have the same value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, then it cancels out in the KL-divergence. Under this assumption, we get that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ad(%5Cell%20%5Cmid%20%5Csigma)%20=%20%5Ctext%7B%60%60%7D%5Clim_%7B%5Cell_0%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty%7D%5Ctext%7B''%7D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D%5Cleft(R(%5Cell_0)%5E%7B-1%7DR(%5Cell)%5Cright)%20%20-%20%5Clog%20%5Cdet%20R(%5Cell)%20+%20%5Clog%20%5Cdet%20R(%5Cell_0)%20-%20n%7D,%0A"> where I’m being a bit cheeky putting that limit in, as we might need to do some singular model jiggery-pokery of the same type we needed to do <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-08-29-priors4/priors4.html#the-speed-of-a-battered-sav-proximity-to-the-base-model">for the standard deviation</a>. We will formalise this, I promise.</p>
<p>As the model gets more complex as the length scale decreases, we want our prior to control the smallest value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> can take. This suggests we want to choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> to ensure <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(%5Cell%20%3C%20L)%20=%20%5Calpha.%0A"> How do we choose the lower bound <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">? One idea is that our prior should have very little probability of the length scale being smaller than the length-scale of the data. So we can chose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> to be the smallest distance between observations (if the data is regularly spaced) or as a low quantile of the distribution of distances between nearest neighbours.</p>
<p>All of this will specify a PC prior for a Gaussian process. So let’s now discuss why that prior is a bit shit.</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-bad-about-this" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-bad-about-this">What’s bad about this?</h3>
<p>The prior on the standard deviation is fine.</p>
<p>The prior on the length scale is more of an issue. There are a couple of bad things about this prior. The first one might seem innocuous at first glance. We decided to treat the GP as a multivariate Gaussian with covariance matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2%20R(%5Ctheta)">. This is not a neutral choice. In order to do it, we need to <em>commit</em> to a certain set of observation locations<sup>13</sup>. Why? The matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R(%5Ctheta)"> depends entirely on the observation locations and if we use this matrix to define the prior we are tied to those locations.</p>
<p>This means that if we change the amount of data in the model we will need to change the prior. This is going to play havoc<sup>14</sup> on any sort of cross-validation! It’s worth saying that the other two sources of information (the minimum length scale and the upper bound on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">) are not nearly as sensitive to small changes in the data. This information is, in some sense, fundamental to the problem at hand and, therefore, much more stable ground to build your prior upon.</p>
<p>There’s another problem, of course: this prior is expensive to compute. The KL divergence involves computing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D(R(%5Cell_0)%5E%7B-1%7DR(%5Cell))"> which costs as much as another log-density evaluation for the Gaussian process (which is to say it’s very expensive).</p>
<p>So this prior is going to be <em>deeply</em> inconvenient if we have varying amounts of data (through cross-validation or sequential data gathering). It’s also going to be wildly more computationally expensive than you expect a one-dimensional prior to be.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems a bit shit.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-matérn-covariance-function" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-matérn-covariance-function">The Matérn covariance function</h3>
<p>It won’t be possible to derive a prior for a general Gaussian process, so we are going to need to make some simplifying assumptions. The assumption that we are going to make is that the covariance comes from the Whittle-Matérn<sup>15</sup> <sup>16</sup> class <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ac(s,%20s')%20=%20%5Csigma%5E2%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5E%7B1-%5Cnu%7D%7D%7B%5CGamma(%5Cnu)%7D%5Cleft(%5Csqrt%7B8%5Cnu%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5C%7Cs-s'%5C%7C%7D%7B%5Cell%7D%5Cright)%5E%5Cnu%20K_%5Cnu%5Cleft(%5Csqrt%7B8%5Cnu%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5C%7Cs-s'%5C%7C%7D%7B%5Cell%7D%5Cright),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> is the <em>smoothness</em> parameter, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> is the <em>length-scale</em> parameter, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> is the <em>marginal standard deviation</em>, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AK_%5Cnu(x)%20=%20%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20e%5E%7B-x%5Ccosh%20t%7D%5Ccosh(%5Cnu%20t)%5C,dt%0A"> is the modified Bessel<sup>17</sup> function of the second kind.</p>
<p>This class of covariance function is extremely important in practice. It interpolates between two of the most common covariance functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20=%201/2">, it corresponds to the exponential covariance function,</li>
<li>when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20=%20%5Cinfty">, it corresponds to the squared exponential covariance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are years of experience suggesting that Matérn covariance functions with finite <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> will often perform better than the squared exponential covariance.</p>
<p>Common practice is to fix<sup>18</sup> the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">. There are a few reasons for this. One of the most compelling practical reasons is that we can’t easily evaluate its derivative, which rules out most modern optimisation and MCMC algorithms. It’s also <em>very</em> difficult to think about how you would set a prior on it. The techniques in this post will not help, and as far as I’ve ever been able to tell, nothing else will either. Finally, you could expect there to be <em>horrible</em> confounding between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, which will make inference very hard (both numerically and morally).</p>
<p>It turns out that even with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> fixed, we will run into a few problems. But to understand those, we are going to need to know a bit more about how inferring parameters in a Gaussian processes actually works.</p>
<p>Just for future warning, I will occasionally refer to a GP with a Matérn covariance function as a “Matérn field”<sup>19</sup>.</p>

<section id="asymptotic-i-barely-know-her" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="asymptotic-i-barely-know-her">Asymptotic? I barely know her!</h3>
<p>Let’s take a brief detour into classical inference for a moment and ask ourselves <em>when can we recover the parameters of a Gaussian process</em>? For most models we run into in statistics, the answer to that question is <em>when we get enough data</em>. But for Gaussian processes, the story is more complex.</p>
<p>First of all, there is the very real question of what we mean by getting more data. When our observations are iid, this so easy that when asked how she got more data, Kylie just said she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDKPvy-ZXC8">“did it again”</a>.</p>
<p>But this is more complex once data has dependence. For instance, in a multilevel model you could have the number of groups staying fixed while the number of observations in each group goes to infinity, you could have the number of observations in each group staying fixed while the number of groups go to infinity, or you could have both<sup>20</sup> going to infinity.</p>
<p>For Gaussian processes it also gets quite complicated. Here is a non-exhaustive list of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You observe the same realisation of the GP at an increasing number of points that eventually cover the <em>whole of</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed"> (this is called the <em>increasing domain</em> or <em>outfill</em> regime); or</li>
<li>You observe the same realisation of the GP at an increasing number of points <em>that stay within a fixed domain</em> (this is called the <em>fixed domain</em> or <em>infill</em> regime); or</li>
<li>You observe multiple realisations of the same GP at a finite number of points that stay in the same location (this does not have a name, in space-time it’s sometimes called <em>monitoring data</em>); or</li>
<li>You observe multiple realisations of the same GP at a (possibly different) finite number of points that can be in different locations for different realisations; or</li>
<li>You observe realisations of a process that evolves in space <em>and</em> time (not really a different regime so much as a different problem).</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the truly unsettling things about Gaussian processes is that the ability to estimate the parameters depends on which of these regimes you choose!</p>
<p>Of course, we all know that asymptotic regimes are just polite fantasies that statisticians concoct in order to self-soothe. They are not reflections on reality. They serve approximately the same purpose<sup>21</sup> as watching a chain of Law and Order episodes.</p>
<p>The point of thinking about what happens when we get more data is to use it as a loose approximation of what happens with the data you have. So the real question is <em>which regime is the most realistic for my data</em>?.</p>
<p>One way you can approach this question is to ask yourself what you would do if you had the budget to get more data. My work has mostly been in spatial statistics, in which case the answer is <em>usually</em><sup>22</sup> that you would sample more points in the same area. This suggests that fixed-domain asymptotics is a good fit for my needs. I’d expect that in most GP regression cases, we’re not expecting<sup>23</sup> that further observations would be on new parts of the covariate space, which would suggest fixed-domain asymptotics are useful there too.</p>
<p>This, it turns out, is awkward.</p>

<p>The problem with a GP with the Matérn covariance function on a fixed domain is that it’s not possible<sup>24</sup> to estimate all of its parameters at the same time. This isn’t the case for the other asymptotic regimes, but you’ve got to dance with who you came to the dance with.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, we need to think about a Gaussian process as a realisation of a function rather than as a vector of observations. Why? Because under fixed-domain asymptotics we are seeing values of the function closer and closer together until we essentially see the entire function on that domain.</p>
<p>Of course, this is why I wrote <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html">a long and technical blog post</a> on understanding Gaussian processes as random functions. But don’t worry. You don’t need to have read that part.</p>
<p>The key thing is that because a GP is a function, we need to think of it’s probability of being in a set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> of functions. There will be a set of function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7Bsupp%7D(u)">, which we call the <em>support</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)">, that is the smallest set such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(u(%5Ccdot)%20%5Cin%20%5Coperatorname%7Bsupp%7D(u))%20=%201.%0A"> Every GP has an associated support and, while you probably don’t think much about it, GPs are <em>obsessed</em> with their supports. They love them. They hug them. They share them with their friends. They keep them from their enemies. And they are one of the key things that we need to think about in order to understand why it’s hard to estimate parameters in a Matérn covariance function.</p>
<p>There is a key theorem that is unique<sup>25</sup> to Gaussian processes. It’s usually phrased in terms of <em>Gaussian measures</em>, which are just the probability associated with a GP. For example, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1(%5Ccdot)"> is a GP then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmu_1(A)%20=%20%5CPr(u_1(%5Ccdot)%20%5Cin%20A)%0A"> is the corresponding Gaussian measure. We can express the support of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)"> as the smallest set of functions such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu(A)=1">.</p>

</div>
<p>Later on in the post, we will see some precise conditions for when two Gaussian measures are equivalent, but for now it’s worth saying that it is a <em>very</em> delicate property. In fact, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2(%5Ccdot)%20=%20%5Calpha%20u_1(%5Ccdot)"> for any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7C%5Calpha%7C%5Cneq%201">, then<sup>30</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_1%20%5Cperp%20%5Cmu_2">!</p>
<p>This seems like it will cause problems. And it can<sup>31</sup>. But it’s <em>fabulous</em> for inference.</p>
<p>To see this, we can use one of the implications of singularity: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_1%20%5Cperp%20%5Cmu_2"> if and only if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(u_1(%5Ccdot)%20%7C%7C%20u_2(%5Ccdot))%20=%20%5Cinfty,%0A"> where the the Kullback-Leibler divergence can be interpreted as the expectation of the likelihood ratio of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1"> vs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2"> under <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1">. Hence, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1(%5Ccdot)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2(%5Ccdot)"> are singular, we can (on average) choose the correct one using a likelihood ratio test. This means that we will be able to correctly recover the true<sup>32</sup> parameter.</p>
<p>It turns out the opposite is also true.</p>

<p>This seems bad but, you know, it’s a pretty strong version of convergence. And sometimes our brothers and sisters in Christ who are more theoretically minded like to give themselves a treat and consider weaker forms of convergence. It turns out that that’s a disaster too.</p>

<p>If you can’t tell the difference between these two theorems that’s ok. You probably weren’t trying to sublimate some childhood trauma and all of your sexual energy into maths just so you didn’t have to deal with the fact that you might be gay and you were pretty sure that wasn’t an option and anyway it’s not like it’s <em>that</em> important. Like whatever, you don’t need physical or emotional intimacy. You’ve got a pile of books on measure theory next to your bed. You are living your best life. Anyway. It makes almost no practical difference. BUT I WILL PROVE IT ANYWAY.</p>

<p>This basically says that the two modes of convergence are quite similar except convergence in probability is relaxed enough to have some<sup>34</sup> values that aren’t doing so good at the whole converging thing.</p>

<p>I’ll go through the proof of this later, but the techniques require a lot of warm up, so let’s just deal with the consequences for now.</p>
<p>Basically, Theorem&nbsp;4 says that we can’t consistently estimate the range and the marginal standard deviation for a one, two, or three dimensional Gaussian process. <a href="https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~zhanghao/Paper/JASA2004.pdf">Hao Zhang noted this</a> and that it remains true<sup>35</sup> when dealing with non-Gaussian data.</p>
<p>The good news, I guess, is that in more than four<sup>36</sup> dimensions the measures are always singular.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t give one single solitary shit about the existence of consistent estimators. I am doing Bayesian things and this post is supposed to be about setting prior distributions. But it is important. Let’s take a look at some simulations.</p>
<p>First up, let’s look at what happens in 2D when we directly (ie with no noise) observe a zero-mean GP with exponential covariance function (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20=%201/2">) at points in the unit square. In this case, the log-likelihood is, up to an additive constant, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clog%20p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)%20=%20-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog%20%7C%5CSigma(%5Ctheta)%7C%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dy%5ET%5CSigma(%5Ctheta)%5E%7B-1%7Dy.%0A"></p>

<p>Clearly there is a ridge in the likelihood surface, which suggests that our posterior is going to be driven by the prior along that ridge.</p>
<p>For completeness, let’s run the same experiment again when we have some known observation noise, that is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i%20%5Csim%20N(u(s_i),%201)">.

<p>Once again, we can see that there is going to be a ridge in the likelihood surface! It’s a bit less disastrous this time, but it’s not excellent even with 500 observations (which is a decent number on a unit square). The weird structure of the likelihood is still going to lead to a long, non-elliptical shape in your posterior that your computational engine (and your person interpreting the results) are going to have to come to terms with. In particular, if you only look at the posterior marginal distributions for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> you may miss the fact that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20%5Cell%5E%7B%5Cnu%7D"> is quite well estimated by the data even though the marginals for both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> are very wide.</p>
<p>This ridge in the likelihood is going to translate somewhat into a ridge in the prior. We will see below that how much of that ridge we see is going to be very dependent on how we specify the prior. The entire purpose of the PC prior is to meaningfully resolve this ridge using sensible prior information.</p>
<p>But before we get to the (improved) PC prior, it’s worthwhile to survey some other priors that have been proposed in the literature.</p>

<p>That ridge in the likelihood surface does not go away in low dimensions, which essentially means that our inference along that ridge is going to be driven by the prior.</p>
<p>Possibly the worst choice you could make in this situation is trying to make a minimally informative prior. Of course, that’s what <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Objective+Bayesian+Analysis+of+Spatially+Correlated+Data%2C&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">somebody did when they made a reference prior for the problem</a>. In fact it was the first paper<sup>39</sup> that looks rigorously at prior distributions on the parameters of GPs. It’s just unfortunate that it’s quite shit. It has still been cited quite a lot. And there are some technical advances to the theory of reference priors, but if you use it you just find yourself mapping out that damn ridge.</p>
<p>On top of being, structurally, a bad choice, the reference prior has a few other downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very computationally intensive and quite complex. Not unlike the bad version of the PC prior!</li>
<li>It requires <em>strong</em> assumptions about the likelihood. The first version assumed that there was no observation noise. Later papers allowed there to be observation noise. But only if it’s Gaussian.</li>
<li>It is derived under the asymptotic regime where an infinite sequence of different independent realisations of the GP are observed at the same finite set of points. This is not the most useful regime for GPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it’s a bit of a casserole.</p>
<p>From the other end, there’s a very interesting contribution from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.3556.pdf">Aad van der Vaart and Harry van Zanten</a> wrote a very lovely theoretical paper that looked at which priors on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> could result in theoretically optimal contraction rates for the posterior of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)">. They argued that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%5E%7B-d%7D"> should have a Gamma distribution. Within the Matérn class, their results are only valid for the squared exponential contrivance function.</p>
<p>One of the stranger things that I have never fully understood is that the argument I’m going to make below ends up with a gamma distribution on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%5E%7B-d/2%7D">, which is somewhat different to van der Vaart and van Zanten. If I was to being forced to bullshit some justification I’d probably say something about the Matérn process depending only on the distance between observations makes the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">-sphere the natural geometry (the volume of which scales like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%5E%7B-d/2%7D">) rather than the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">-cube (the volume of which scales lie <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%5E%7B-d%7D">). But that would be total bullshit. I simply have no idea. They’re proposal comes via the time-honoured tradition of “constant chasing” in some fairly tricky proofs, so I have absolutely no intuition for it.</p>
<p>We also found in other contexts that use the KL divergence rather than its square root tended to perform worse. So I’m kinda happy with our scaling and, really, their paper doesn’t cover the covariance functions I’m considering in this post.</p>
<p>Neither<sup>40</sup> of these papers consider that ridge in the likelihood surface.</p>
<p>This lack of consideration—as well as their success in everything else we tried them on—was a big part of our push to make a useful version of a PC prior for Gaussian processes.</p>

<p>It has been a long journey, but we are finally where I wanted us to be. So let’s talk about how to fix the PC prior. In particular, I’m going to go through how to derive a prior on the length scale <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> that has a simple form.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, we are going to do three things in the rest of this post:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Restrict our attention to the stationary<sup>41</sup> GPs</li>
<li>Restrict our attention to the Matérn class of covariance functions.</li>
<li>Greatly increase our mathematical<sup>42</sup> sophistication.</li>
</ol>
<p>But before we do that, I’m going to walk you through the punchline.</p>
<p>This work was originally done with the magnificent <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/fuglstad">Geir-Arne Fuglstad</a>, the glorious <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~flindgre/">Finn Lindren</a>, and the resplendent <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/haavard-rue">Håvard Rue</a>. If you want to read the original paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00256">the preprint is here</a><sup>43</sup>.</p>
<p>The PC prior is derived using the base model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%20%5Cinfty">, which might seem like a slightly weird choice. The intuition behind it is that if there is strong dependence between far away points, the realisations of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)"> cannot be too wiggly. In some context people talk about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> as a <em>“smoothness”</em><sup>44</sup> parameter because realisations with large <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> “look”<sup>45</sup> smoother than realisations with small <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">.</p>
<p>Another way to see the same thing is to note that a Matérn field approaches a<sup>46</sup> smoothing spline prior, in which case <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E%7B-2%7D"> plays the role of the “smoothing parameter” of the spline. In that case, the natural base model of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma=0"> interacts with the base model of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%20%5Cinfty"> to shrink towards an increasingly flat surface centred on zero.</p>
<p>We still need to choose a quantity of interest in order to encode some explicit information in the prior. In this case, I’m going to use the idea that for any data set, we only have information up to a certain spatial resolution. In that case, we don’t want to put prior mass on the length scale being less than that resolution. Why? Well any inference about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> at a smaller scale than the data resolution is going to be driven entirely by unverifiable model assumptions. And that feels a bit awkward. This suggests that we chose a minimum<sup>47</sup> length scale <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> and choose the scaling parameter in the PC prior so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(%5Cell%20%3C%20L)%20%3C%20%5Calpha_%5Cell.%0A"></p>
<p>Under these assumptions, the PC prior for the length scale in a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">-dimensional space is<sup>48</sup> a Fréchet distribution<sup>49</sup> with shape parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d/2"> and scale parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cell%5E%7B2/d%7D">. That is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Clambda_%5Cell%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Cell%5E%7B-(d/2+1)%7De%5E%7B-%5Clambda_%7B%5Cell%7D%5Cell%5E%7B-d/2%7D%7D,%0A"> where we choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cell%20=%20-%5Clog(%5Calpha_%5Cell)L%5E%7Bd/2%7D"> to ensure that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(%5Cell%20%3C%20L)%20=%20e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%20L%5E%7B-d/2%7D%7D%20%3C%20%5Calpha_%5Cell.%0A"></p>
<p>In two dimensions, this is an inverse gamma prior, which gives rigorous justification to a commonly used prior in spatial statistics.</p>

<section id="comparing-it-with-the-reference-prior" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparing-it-with-the-reference-prior">Comparing it with the reference prior</h3>
<p>Ok, so let’s actually see how much of a difference using a weakly informative prior makes relative to using the reference prior.</p>
<p>In the interest of computational speed, I’m going to use the simplest possible model setup, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ay%20%5Cmid%20%5Csigma,%5Cell%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20%5Csigma%5E2%20R(%5Cell)),%0A"> and I’m only going to use 25 observations.</p>
<p>In this case<sup>50</sup> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cell,%20%5Csigma)%20=%20%5Csigma%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft(%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20R%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Cell%7DR%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cright)%5E2%5Cright%5D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20R%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Cell%7DR%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cright)%5E2%5Cright)%5E%7B1/2%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>Even with this limited setup, it took a lot of work to make Stan sample this posterior. You’ll notice that I did a ridge-aware reparameterisation. I also had to run twice as much warm up as I ordinarily would.</p>
<p>The Stan code is under the fold.</p>

<p>As expected, the PC prior (black) pulls the posterior towards the base model (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%20%5Cinfty">), but what is interesting to me is that the posterior for the reference prior (red) has so much mass near zero. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U-7L1tmBAo">That’s the one thing we didn’t want to happen</a>.</p>
<p>We can look closer at this by looking at the posterior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa%20=%202%5Cell%5E%7B-1%7D">.</p>

<p>You can see here that the prior is putting <em>a lot</em> of weight at zero relative to the likelihood surface, which is relatively flat.</p>
<p>It’s also important to notice that the ridge isn’t as flat with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=25"> as it is with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=500">. It would be very interesting to repeat this with larger values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">, but frankly I do not have the time.</p>

<section id="moving-beyond-the-matérn" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moving-beyond-the-matérn">Moving beyond the Matérn</h3>
<p>There is <em>a lot</em> more to say on this topic. But honestly this blog post is already enormous (you are a bit over halfway if you choose to read the technical guff). So I’m just going to summarise some of the things that I think are important here.</p>
<p>Firstly, the rigorous construction of the PC prior only makes sense when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%20%5Cleq%203">. This is a bit annoying, but it is what it is. I would argue that this construction is still fairly reasonable in moderate dimensions. (In high dimensions I think we need more research.)</p>
<p>There are two ways to see that. Firstly, if you look at the derivation of the distance, it involves an infinite sum that only converges when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%20%3C%204">. But mathematically, if we can show<sup>51</sup> that the partial sums can be bounded independently of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">, then we can just send another thing to infinity when we send the domain size and the base model length scale there.</p>
<p>A different way is to see this is to note that the PC prior distance is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d(%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cell%5E%7B-d/2%7D">. This is proportional to the inverse of the volume of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">-sphere<sup>52</sup> of radius <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">. This doesn’t seem like a massively useful observation, but just wait.</p>
<p>What if we ask ourselves “what is the average variance of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> over a ball of radius <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">?”. If we write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_%7B%5Cell,%5Csigma%7D(h)"> as the Matérn covariance function, then<sup>53</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Coperatorname%7BVar%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Coperatorname%7BVol%7D(%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D_d(r))%7D%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D_d(r)%7Du(s)%5C,ds%5Cright)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Coperatorname%7BVol%7D(%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D_d(r))%7D%20%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Ctilde%7Bc%7D_%7B%5Cell,%20%5Csigma%7D(t)%20t%5E%7Bd-1%7D%5C,dt,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20c_%7B%5Cell,%20%5Csigma%7D(t)%20=%20c_%7B%5Cell,%20%5Csigma%7D(h)"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Ch%5C%7C%20=%20t">. If we remember that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_%7B%5Cell,%20%5Csigma%7D(s)%20=%20c_%7B1,%20%5Csigma%7D(%5Cell%20s)">, then we can write this as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Coperatorname%7BVol%7D(%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D_d(r))%7D%20%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Ctilde%7Bc%7D_%7B1,%20%5Csigma%7D(%5Cell%20t)%20t%5E%7Bd-1%7D%5C,dt%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cell%5E%7B-d%7D%7D%7B%5Coperatorname%7BVol%7D(%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D_d(r))%7D%20%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Ctilde%7Bc%7D_%7B1,%20%5Csigma%7D(v)%20v%5E%7Bd-1%7D%5C,dv.%0A"> Hence the PC prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell"> is penalising the change in average standard deviation over a ball relative to the unit length scale. With this interpretation, the base model is, once again, zero standard deviation. This reasoning carries over to the length scale parameter in <em>any</em><sup>54</sup> Gaussian process.</p>
<p>This post only covers the simplest version of Matérn GPs. One simple extension is to construct a non-stationary GP by replacing the Euclidean distance with the distance on a manifold with volume element <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R(s)%5C,ds">. This might seem like a weird and abstract thing to do, but it’s an intrinsic specification of the popular deformation method due to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2290458">Guttorp and Samson</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00256">Our paper</a> covers the prior specification in this case.</p>
<p>The other common case that I’ve not considered here is the extension where there is a different length scale<sup>55</sup> in each dimension. In this case, we could compute a PC prior independently for each dimension (so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d=1"> for each prior). To be completely honest with you, I worry a little bit about that choice in high dimensions<sup>56</sup> (products of independent priors being notoriously weird), but I don’t have a better suggestion.</p>

<p>So you might have noticed that even though the previous section is a “conclusion” section, there is quite a bit more blog to go. I shan’t lie: this whole thing up to this point is a tl;dr that got wildly out of control.</p>
<p>The rest of the post is the details.</p>
<p>There are two parts. The first part covers enough<sup>57</sup> of the theory of stationary GPs to allow us to understand the second part, which actually derives the PC prior.</p>
<p>It’s going to get a bit hairy and I’m going to assume you’ve at least skimmed through the first 2 definitions in my <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html">previous post defining GPs</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-2-an-invitation-to-the-theory-of-stationary-gaussian-processes">Part 2: An invitation to the theory of Stationary Gaussian processes</h2>
<p>Gaussian processes with the Matérn covariance function are an excellent example of a stationary<sup>58</sup> Gaussian process, which are characterised<sup>59</sup> <sup>60</sup> by have covariance functions of the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ac(s,%20s')%20=%20c(s-%20s'),%0A"> where I am abusing notation and using <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> for both the two parameter and one parameter functions. This assumption means that the correlation structure does not depend on where you are in space, only on the distance between points.</p>
<p>The assumption of stationarity massively simplifies GPs. Firstly, the stationarity assumption greatly reduces the number of parameters you need to describe a GP as we don’t need to worry about location-specific parameters. Secondly, it increases the statistical power of the data. If two subsets of the domain are more than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%5Cell"> apart, they are essentially independent replicates of the GP with the same parameters. This means that if the locations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> vary across a large enough area (relative to the natural length scale), we get multiple effective replicates<sup>61</sup> from the same realisation of the process.</p>
<p>In practice, stationarity<sup>62</sup> is often a <em>good enough</em> assumption when the mean has been modelled carefully, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0743">especially given the limitations of the data</a>. That said, priors on non-stationary processes can be set using the PC prior methodology by using a stationary process as the base model. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00256">supplementary material</a> of our paper gives a simple, but useful, example of this.</p>
<section id="stationary-covariance-functions-and-bochners-theorem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stationary-covariance-functions-and-bochners-theorem">Stationary covariance functions and Bochner’s theorem</h3>
<p>The restriction to stationary processes is <em>extremely</em> powerful. It opens us up to using Fourier analysis as a potent tool for understanding GPs. We are going to need this to construct our KL divergence, and so with some trepidation, let’s dive into the moonee ponds of spectral representations.</p>
<p>The first thing that we need to do is remember what a <em>Fourier transform</em> is. A Fourier transform of a square integrable function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi(s)"> is<sup>63</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Chat%20%5Cphi(%5Comega)%20=%20%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D(%5Cphi)(%5Comega)%20=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B(2%5Cpi)%5Ed%7D%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%20e%5E%7B-i%5Comega%5ETs%7D%5Cphi(s)%20%5C,ds.%0A"></p>
<p>If you have bad memories<sup>64</sup> of desperately trying to compute Fourier integrals in undergrad, I promise you that we are not doing that today. We are simply affirming their right to exist (and my right to look them up in a table).</p>

<p>One particular advantage of stationary processes is that we get a straightforward characterization of the Cameron-Martin space inner product. Recall that the Cameron-Martin space (or reproducing kernel Hilbert space) associated with a Gaussian process is the<sup>86</sup> space of all functions of the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ah(s)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5EK%20c_k%20c(s,%20s_k),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> is finite, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_k"> are real, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_k"> are distinct points in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed">. This is the space that the posterior mean for GP regression lives in.</p>
<p>The inner product associated with this space can be written in terms of the spectral density <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> as<sup>87</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clangle%20h,%20h'%5Crangle%20=%20%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%20%5Chat%20h(%5Comega)%20%5Coverline%7B%5Chat%20%7Bh'%7D(%5Comega)%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bf(%5Comega)%7D%5C,d%5Comega.%0A"> In particular, for a Matérn Gaussian process, the corresponding norm is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7C%20h%5C%7C_%7BH_u%7D%20=%20C_%5Ctext%7BMat%C3%A9rn%7D%5Ckappa%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma%5E2%20%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%7C%5Chat%20h(%5Comega)%7C%5E2%20(%5Ckappa%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%7B%5Cnu+d/2%7D%5C,d%5Comega.%0A"> For those of you familiar with function spaces, this is equivalent to the norm on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H%5E%7B%5Cnu+d/2%7D(%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed)">. One way to interpret this is that the <em>set</em> of functions in the Cameron-Martin space for a Matérn GP only depends on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">, while the norm and inner product (and hence the posterior mean and all that stuff) depend on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.

<p>When these three conditions are fulfilled, the Radon-Nikodym derivative is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cmu_2%7D%7Bd%5Cmu_1%7D%20=%20%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cdelta_k%7D%7B1%20+%20%5Cdelta_k%7D%5Ceta_k%5E2%20-%20%5Clog(1+%5Cdelta_k)%5Cright)%5Cright%5D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ceta_k"> is an sequence of N(0,1) random variables<sup>93</sup> <sup>94</sup> (under <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_1">).</p>
<p>Otherwise, the two measures are singular.</p>
</div>
<p>This version of Feldman-Hájek is considerably more useful than its previous incarnation. The first condition basically says that the posterior means from the two priors will have the same smoothness and is rarely a problem. Typically the second condition is fulfilled in practice (for example, we always set the mean to zero).</p>
<p>The third condition is where all of the action is. This is, roughly speaking, a condition that says that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_2"> aren’t toooooo different. To understand this, we need to look a little at what the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta_k"> values actually are. It turns out to actually be easier to ask about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1+%20%5Cdelta_k">, which are the eigenvalues of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_1%5E%7B-1/2%7DC_2%20C_1%5E%7B-1/2%7D">. In that case, we are trying to find the orthonormal system of functions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi_k%5Cin%20X"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0AC_1%5E%7B-1/2%7DC_2%20C_1%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5Cphi_k%20&amp;=%20(1+%5Cdelta_k)%20%5Cphi_k%20%5C%5C%0AC%5E%7B-1/2%7DC_2%20%5Cpsi_k%20&amp;=%20(1+%5Cdelta_k)%20C_1%5E%7B1/2%7D%5Cpsi_k%20%5C%5C%0AC_2%5Cpsi_k%20&amp;=(1+%5Cdelta_k)%20C_1%5Cpsi_k,%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpsi_k%20=%20C_1%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5Cphi_k">.</p>
<p>Hence, we can roughly interpret the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta_k"> as the eigenvalues of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_1%5E%7B-1%7DC_2%20-%20I.%0A"> The Hilbert-Schmidt condition is then requiring that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_1%5E%7B-1%7DC_2"> is not infinitely far from the identity mapping.</p>
<p>A particularly nice version of this theorem occurs when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_2"> have the <em>same</em> eigenvectors. This is a fairly restrictive assumption, but we are going to end up using it later, so it’s worth specialising. In that case, assuming <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_j"> has eigenvalues <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(j)%7D"> and corresponding <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E2">-orthogonal eigenfunctions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi_k(%5Ccdot)">, we can write<sup>95</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5BC_jh%5D(s)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(j)%7D%20%5Clangle%5Cphi_k,%20h%5Crangle%20%5Cphi_k(s).%0A"> Using the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions, we can show<sup>96</sup> that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5BC_j%5E%7B%5Cbeta%7Dh%5D(s)=%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20(%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(j)%7D)%5E%5Cbeta%20%5Clangle%5Cphi_k,%20h%5Crangle%20%5Cphi_k(s).%0A"></p>
<p>With a bit of effort, we can see that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(C_1%5E%7B-1/2%7DC_2C_1%5E%7B-1/2%7D%20-%20I)h%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(2)%7D%20-%20%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(1)%7D%7D%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(1)%7D%7D%20%5Clangle%5Cphi_k,%20h%5Crangle%20%5Cphi_k%0A"> and so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cdelta_k%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(2)%7D%20-%20%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(1)%7D%7D%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(1)%7D%7D.%0A"> From that, we get<sup>97</sup> the KL divergence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(%5Cmu_1%20%7C%7C%20%5Cmu_2)%20&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_1%7D%5Clog%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cmu_2%7D%7Bd%5Cmu_2%7D%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cdelta_k%7D%7B1%20+%20%5Cdelta_k%7D%20-%20%5Clog(1+%5Cdelta_k)%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(2)%7D%7D%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(1)%7D%7D%20-1+%20%5Clog%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(2)%7D%7D%7B%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(1)%7D%7D%5Cright)%5Cright%5D.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>Possibly unsurprisingly, this is simply the sum of the one dimensional divergences <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(N(0,%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(1)%7D)%20%7C%7C%20N(0,%5Clambda_k%5E%7B(2)%7D)).%0A"> It’s fun to convince yourself that that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bk=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cdelta_k%5E2%20%3C%20%5Cinfty"> is sufficient to ensure the sum converges.</p>

<p>Ok. So I lied. I suggested that we’d use all of that spectral stuff in the last section. And we didn’t! Because I’m dastardly. But this time I promise we will!</p>
<p>It turns out that even with our fancy version of Feldman-Hájek, it can be difficult<sup>98</sup> to work out whether two Gaussian processes are singular or equivalent. One of the big challenges is that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions depend on the domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> and so we would, in principle, have to check this quite complex condition for every single domain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is an easy to parse sufficient condition that we can use that show when two GPs are equivalent on <em>every</em> bounded domain. These conditions are stated in terms of the spectral densities.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~wahba/stat860public/pdf1/skorokhod.yadrenko.1973.pdf">proof</a> of this is pretty nifty. Essentially it constructs the operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T+I"> in a sneaky<sup>100</sup> way and then bounds its trace on rectangle containing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">. That upper bound is finite precisely when the above integral is finite.</p>
<p>Now that we have a relatively simple condition for equivalence, let’s look at Matérn fields. In particular, we will assume <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_j(%5Ccdot)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j=1,2"> are two Matérn GPs with the same smoothness parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> and other parameters<sup>101</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ckappa_j,%20%5Csigma_j)">. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bf_2(%5Comega)%20-%20f_1(%5Comega)%7D%7Bf_1(%5Comega)%7D%5Cright)%5E2%5C,d%5Comega%20%20=%20%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Ckappa_2%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma_2%5E2(%5Ckappa_2%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%7B-%5Cnu%20-%20d/2%7D%20%7D%7B%5Ckappa_1%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma_1%5E2(%5Ckappa_1%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%7B-%5Cnu%20-%20d/2%7D%7D-1%5Cright)%5E2%5C,d%5Comega.%0A"> We can save ourselves some trouble by considering two cases separately.</p>

<p>In this case, we can make the change to spherical coordinates via the substitution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C"> and, again to save my poor fingers, let’s set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20=%20%5Cnu%20+%20d/2">. The condition becomes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%5Cleft%5B%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Ckappa_1%5E2%20+%20r%5E2%20%7D%7B%5Ckappa_2%5E2%20+%20r%5E2%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B%5Calpha%7D-1%5Cright%5D%5E2r%5E%7Bd-1%7D%5C,dr%20%3C%20%5Cinfty.%0A"> To check that this integral is finite, first note that, near <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r=0">, the integrand is<sup>102</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(%7Br%5E%7Bd-1%7D%7D)">, so there is no problem there.

Hence, the two fields are equivalent whenever <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%5Cleq%203"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa_1%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma_1%5E2%20=%20%5Ckappa_2%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma_2%5E2">.

<p>Let’s define <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_3%20=%20%5Csigma_2(%5Ckappa_2/%5Ckappa_1)%5E%5Cnu">. Then it’s clear that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa_1%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma_3%5E2%20=%20%5Ckappa_2%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma_2%5E2"> and therefore the Matérn field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_3"> with parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ckappa_1,%20%5Csigma_3,%20%5Cnu)"> is equivalent to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2(%5Ccdot)">.</p>
<p>We will now show that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_3"> are singular, which implies that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_2"> are singular.

<p>Now, you can find a proof of this in the appendix of our JASA paper, but to be honest it’s quite informal. But although you can sneak any old shite into JASA, this is a blog goddammit and a blog has integrity. So let’s do a significantly more rigorous proof of our argument.</p>
<p>To do this, we will need to find the KL divergence between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_1">, with parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ckappa,%20%5Ctau%20%5Ckappa_1%5E%7B-%5Cnu%7D,%20%5Cnu)"> and a base model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_0"> with parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ckappa_0,%20%5Ctau%20%5Ckappa_0%5E%7B-%5Cnu%7D,%20%5Cnu)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa_0"> is some fixed, small number and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%20%3E0"> is fixed. We will actually be interested in the behaviour of the KL divergence as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa_0"> goes to zero. Why? Because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa_0%20=%200"> is our base model.</p>
<p>The specific choice of standard deviation in both models ensures that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma%5E2%20=%20%5Ckappa_0%5E%7B2%5Cnu%7D%5Csigma_0%5E2"> and so the KL divergence is finite.</p>
<p>In order to approximate the KL divergence, we are going to find a basis that simultaneously diagonalises both processes. In the paper, we simply declared that we could do this. And, morally, we can. But as I said a blog aims to a higher standard than mere morality. Here we strive for meaningless rigour.</p>
<p>To that end, we are going to spend a moment thinking about how this can be done in a way that isn’t intrinsically tied to a given domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">. There may well be a lot of different ways to do this, but the most obvious one is to notice that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)"> is <em>periodic</em> on the cube <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B-L,L%5D%5Ed"> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%20%5Cgg%200">, then it can be considered as a GP on a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">-dimensional torus. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> is large enough that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%20%5Csubset%20%5B-L,L%5D%5Ed">, then we might be able to focus on our cube and forget all about the specific domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">.</p>
<p>A nice thing about periodic GPs is that we actually know their Karhunen-Loève<sup>106</sup> representation. In particular, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_p(%5Ccdot)"> is a stationary covariance function on a torus, then we<sup>107</sup> know that it’s eigenfunctions are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphi_k(s)%20=%20e%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%20i%7D%7BL%7D%20k%5ETh%7D,%20%5Cquad%20k%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Ed%0A"> and its eigenvalues are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clambda_k%20=%20%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D%5Ed%7D%20e%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%20i%7D%7BL%7D%20k%5ETh%7D%20c_p(h)%5C,dh.%0A"> This gives<sup>108</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ac_p(h)%20=%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7BL%7D%5Cright)%5Ed%20%5Csum_%7Bk%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Ed%7D%5Clambda_k%20%20e%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%20i%7D%7BL%7D%20k%5ETh%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>Now we have some work to do. Firstly, our process is not periodic<sup>109</sup> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed">. That’s a bit of a barrier. Secondly, even if it were, we don’t actually know what <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_k"> is going to be. This is probably<sup>110</sup> an issue.</p>
<p>So let’s make this sucker periodic. The trick is to note that, at long enough distances, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s')"> are almost uncorrelated. In particular, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Cs%20-%20s'%5C%7C%20%5Cgg%20%5Cell">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7BCov%7D(u(s),%20u(s'))%20%5Capprox%200">. This means that if we are interested in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)"> on a fixed domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D">, then we can replace it with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_p(s)"> that is a GP where the covariance function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_p(%5Ccdot)"> is the periodic extension of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c(h)"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B-L,L%5D%5Ed"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed"> (aka we just repeat it!).</p>
<p>This repetition won’t be noticed on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> as long as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> is big enough. But we can run into the small<sup>111</sup> problem. This procedure can lead to a covariance function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_p(%5Ccdot)"> that is <em>not</em> positive definite. Big problem. Huge.</p>
<p>It turns out that one way to fix this is is to use a smooth cutoff function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta(h)"> that is 1 on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B-L,L%5D%5Ed"> and 0 outside of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B-%5Cgamma,%5Cgamma%5D%5Ed">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%3E0"> is big enough so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%20%5Csubset%20%5B-L,%20L%5D%5Ed"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma%20%3E%20L">. We can then build the periodic extension of a stationary covariance function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c(%5Ccdot)"> as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ac_p(h)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bk%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Ed%7Dc(x%20+%202Lk)%5Cdelta(x%20+%202%20Lk).%0A"> It’s important<sup>112</sup> to note that this is not the same thing as simply repeating the covariance function in a periodic manner. Near the boundaries (but outside of the domain) there will be some reach-around contamination. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05559">Bachmayr, Cohen, and Migliorati</a> show that this <em>does not work</em> for general stationary covariance functions, but does work under the additional condition that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma"> is big enough and there exist some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s%20%5Cgeq%20r%20%3E%20d/2"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%20%3C%20%5Cunderline%7BC%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Coverline%7BC%7D%20%3C%20%5Cinfty"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cunderline%7BC%7D(1%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%7B-s%7D%20%5Cleq%20f(%5Comega)%5Cleq%20%5Coverline%7BC%7D(1%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%7B-r%7D.%0A"> This condition obviously holds for the Matérn covariance function and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13522">Bachmayr, Graham, Nguyen, and Scheichl</a><sup>113</sup> showed that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma%20%3E%20A(d,%20%5Cnu)%5Cell"> for some explicit function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> that only depends on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> is sufficient to make this work.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this procedure is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_p(s-s')%20=%20c(s-s')"> as long as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s,%20s'%20%5Cin%20D">, which means that our inference is going to be <em>identical</em> on our sample as it would be with the non-periodic covariance function! Splendid!</p>
<p>Now that we have made a valid periodic extension (and hence we know what the eigenfunctions are), we need to work out what the corresponding eigenvalues are.</p>
<p>We know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%20e%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%20i%7D%7BL%7Dk%5ETh%7Dc(h)%5C,dh%20=%20f%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7BL%7Dk%5Cright).%0A"> But it is not clear what will happen when we take the Fourier transform of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_p(%5Ccdot)">.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the convolution theorem is here to help us and we know that, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta(s)%20=%201%20-%20%5Cdelta(s)">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%20e%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%20i%7D%7BL%7Dk%5ETh%7D(c(h)%20-%20c_p(h))%5C,dh%20=%20(%5Chat%7B%5Ctheta%7D*f)%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7BL%7Dk%5Cright),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?*"> is the convolution operator.</p>
<p>In the perfect world, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Chat%7B%5Ctheta%7D*f)(%5Comega)"> would be very close to zero, so we can just replace the Fourier transform of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_p"> with the Fourier transform of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">. And thank god we live in a perfect world.</p>
<p>The specifics here are a bit tedious<sup>114</sup>, but you can show that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Chat%7B%5Ctheta%7D*f)(%5Comega)%20%5Crightarrow%200"> as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty">. For Matérn fields, Bachmayr etc performed some heroic calculations to show that the difference is exponentially small as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty"> and that, as long as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma%20%3E%20A(%5Cnu)%20%5Cell">, everything is positive definite and lovely.</p>
<p>So after a bunch of effort and a bit of a literature dive, we have finally got a simultaneous eigenbasis and we can write our KL divergence as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(u_1%20%7C%7C%20u_0)%20&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Csum_%7B%5Comega%20%5Cin%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7BL%7D%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7Bf_1(%5Comega)%7D%7Bf_0(%5Comega)%7D%20-%201%20-%20%5Clog%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bf_1(%5Comega)%7D%7Bf_0(%5Comega)%7D%5Cright)%5Cright%5D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Csum_%7B%5Comega%20%5Cin%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7BL%7D%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B(%5Ckappa_0%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%7B(%5Ckappa%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%20-%201%20-%20%5Clog%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B(%5Ckappa_0%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%7B(%5Ckappa%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%20%5Cright)%5Cright%5D.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> We can write this as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(u_1%20%7C%7C%20u_0)%20=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BL%20%5Ckappa%7D%7B2%5Cpi%7D%5Cright)%5Ed%20%5Csum_%7B%5Comega%20%5Cin%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7BL%7D%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%7D%5Cleft(%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B(%5Ckappa_0%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%7B(%5Ckappa%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%20-%201%20-%20%5Clog%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B(%5Ckappa_0%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%7B(%5Ckappa%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%20%5Cright)+%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(e%5E%7B-C%5Cgamma%7D)%5Cright%5D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7BL%20%5Ckappa%7D%5Cright)%5Ed%5Cright)%20,%0A"> for some constant <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> that you can actually work out but I really don’t need to. The important thing is that the error is exponentially small in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cgamma">, which is very large and spiraling rapidly out towards infinity.</p>
<p>Then, noticing that the sum is just a trapezium rule approximation to a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">-dimensional integral, we get, as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa_0%20%5Crightarrow%200"> (and hence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L,%20%5Cgamma%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty">), <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(u_1%20%7C%7C%20u_0)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BL%20%5Ckappa%7D%7B2%5Cpi%7D%5Cright)%5Ed%20%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B((%5Ckappa_0/%5Ckappa)%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%7B(1%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%20-%201%20-%20%5Clog%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B((%5Ckappa_0/%5Ckappa)%5E2%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%7B(1%20+%20%5C%7C%5Comega%5C%7C%5E2)%5E%5Calpha%7D%20%5Cright)%5Cright%5D%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(1).%0A"> The integral converges whenever <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%20%5Cleq%203">.</p>

<p>This distance does not depend on the specific domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> (or the observation locations), which is an improvement over the PC prior I derived in the introduction. Instead, it only assumes that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> is bounded, which isn’t really a big restriction in practice.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-pc-prior-for-sigma-ell">The PC prior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Csigma,%20%5Cell)"></h3>
<p>With all of this in hand, we can now construct the PC prior. Instead of working directly with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Csigma,%20%5Cell)">, we will instead derive the prior for the estimable parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%20=%20%5Ckappa%5E%5Cnu%20%5Csigma">, and the non-estimable parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa">.</p>
<p>We know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%5E2"> multiplies the covariance function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)">, so it makes sense to treat <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> like a standard deviation parameter. In this case, the PC prior is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Ctau%20%5Cmid%20%5Ckappa)%20=%20%5Clambda_%5Ctau(%5Ckappa)e%5E%7B-%5Clambda_%5Ctau(%5Ckappa)%20%5Ctau%7D.%0A"> The canny among you would have noticed that I have made the scaling parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> depend on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa">. I have done this because the quantity of interest that we want our prior to control is the marginal standard deviation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20=%20%5Ckappa%5E%5Cnu%20%5Ctau">, which is a function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa">. If we want to ensure <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(%5Csigma%20%3C%20U_%5Csigma)%20=%20%5Calpha_%5Csigma">, we need <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clambda_%5Ctau(%5Ckappa)%20=%20-%5Ckappa%5E%5Cnu%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog%20%5Calpha_%5Csigma%7D%7BU_%5Csigma%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>We can now derive the PC prior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa">. The distance that we just spent all that effort calculating, and an exponential prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa%5E%7Bd/2%7D"> leads<sup>115</sup> to the prior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Ckappa)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7B2%7D%5Clambda_%5Cell%20%5Ckappa%5E%7Bd/2-1%7De%5E%7B-%5Clambda_%5Cell%20%5Ckappa%5E%7Bd/2%7D%7D.%0A"> Note that in this case, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_%5Cell"> does not depend on any other parameters: this is because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20=%20%5Csqrt%7B8%5Cnu%7D%5Ckappa%5E%7B-1%7D"> is our identifiable parameter. If we require <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(%5Cell%20%3C%20L_%5Cell)%20=%20%5Calpha_%5Cell">, we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clambda_%5Cell%20=%20-%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BL_%5Cell%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B8%5Cnu%7D%7D%5Cright)%5E%7Bd/2%7D%20%5Clog%20%5Calpha_%5Cell.%0A"></p>
<p>Hence the joint PC prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ckappa,%20%5Ctau)">, which is emphatically <em>not</em> the product of two independent priors, is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Ckappa,%20%5Ctau)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7B2U_%5Csigma%7D%5Clog%20(%5Calpha_%5Cell)%5Clog(%5Calpha_%5Csigma)%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BL_%5Cell%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B8%5Cnu%7D%7D%5Cright)%5E%7Bd/2%7D%20%5Ckappa%5E%7B%5Cnu%20+%20d/2-1%7D%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BL_%5Cell%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B8%5Cnu%7D%7D%5Cright)%5E%7Bd/2%7D%7C%20%5Clog%20(%5Calpha_%5Cell)%7C%20%5Ckappa%5E%7Bd/2%7D%20-%5Cfrac%7B%7C%5Clog%20%5Calpha_%5Csigma%7C%7D%7BU_%5Csigma%7D%20%5Ctau%5Ckappa%5E%5Cnu%5Cright%5D.%0A"></p>
<p>Great gowns, beautiful gowns.</p>
<p>Of course, we don’t want the prior on some weird parameterisation (even though we needed that parameterisation to derive it). We want it on the original parameterisation. And here is where some magic happens! When we transform this prior to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Cell,%20%5Csigma)">-space it magically<sup>116</sup> becomes the product of two independent priors! In particular, the PC prior that encodes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(%5Cell%20%3C%20L_%5Cell)%20=%20%5Calpha_%5Cell"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(%5Csigma%20%3E%20U_%5Csigma)%20=%20%5Calpha_%5Csigma"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cell,%20%5Csigma)%20=%20%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7B2%7D%7C%5Clog(%5Calpha_%5Cell)%7CL_%5Cell%5E%7Bd/2%7D%20%5Cell%5E%7B-d/2-1%7D%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%7C%5Clog(%5Calpha_%5Cell)%7CL_%5Cell%5E%7Bd/2%7D%20%5Cell%5E%7B-d/2%7D%5Cright)%5Cright%5D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B%7C%5Clog(%5Calpha_%5Csigma)%7C%7D%7BU_%5Csigma%7D%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%5Cfrac%7B%7C%5Clog(%5Calpha_%5Csigma)%7C%7D%7BU_%5Csigma%7D%5Csigma%5Cright)%5Cright%5D.%0A"></p>

This is still a weak prior.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Conceptually. The mathematics of what happens as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Crightarrow%200"> aren’t really worth focusing on.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn14"><p>You can find Bayesians who say that they don’t care if cross validation works or not. You can find Bayesians who will say just about anything.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>There are lots of parameterisations, but they’re all easy to move between. Compared to wikipedia, we use the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7B8%7D"> scaling rather than the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7B2%7D"> scaling.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn21"><p>Asymptotics as copaganda.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>I mean, if you can repeat experiments that’s obviously amazing, but there are lots of situations where that is either not possible or not the greatest use of resources. There’s an interesting sub-field of statistical earth sciences that focuses on working out the value of getting new types of observations in spatial data. This particular variant of the value of information problem throws up some fun corners.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn27"><p>measurable↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>This will seem a bit weird if it’s the first time you’ve seen the concept. In finite dimensions (aka most of statistics) <em>every</em> Gaussian is equivalent to every other Gaussian. In fact, it’s equivalent to every other continuous distribution with non-zero density on the whole of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed">. But shit gets weird when you’re dealing with functions and we just need to take a hit of the video head cleaner and breathe until we get used to it.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>These measures <em>are not the same</em>. They just happen to be non-zero on the same sets.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>This was proven in the monster GP blog post.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn32"><p>if it exists↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>This can be interpreted as the event that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7C%5Chat%5Ctheta_n%20-%20%5Ctheta_0%7C%20%3E%20%5Cepsilon"> infinity many times for every epsilon. If this event occurs with any probability, it would strongly suggest that the estimator is not bloody converging.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>or even many↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>Technically, a recent paper in JRSSSB said that if you add an iid Gaussian process you will get identifiability, but that’s maybe not the most realistic asymptotic approximation.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>The fourth dimension is where mathematicians go to die↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn43"><p>I’m moderately sure that the preprint is pretty similar to the published version but I am not going to check.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>Can’t stress enough that this is smoothness in a qualitative sense rather than in the more technical “how differentiable is it?” sense.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn45"><p>Truly going wild with the scare quotes. Always a sign of excellent writing.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn46"><p>For the usual smoothing spline with the square of the Laplacian, you need <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20=%202%20-%20d/2">. Other values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> still give you splines, just with different differentiability assumptions.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn47"><p>If your data is uniformly spaced, you can use the minimum. Otherwise, I suggest a low quantile of the distribution of distances. Or just a bit of nous.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn48"><p>The second half of this post is devoted to proving this. And it is <em>long</em>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn49"><p>With this parameterisation it’s sometimes known as a Type-II Gumbel distribution. Because why not.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn50"><p>And <em>only</em> in this case! The reference prior changes a lot when there is a non-zero mean, when there are other covariates, when there is observation noise, etc etc. It really is quite a wobbly construction.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn51"><p>Readers, I have not bothered to show.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn52"><p>Part of why I’m reluctant to claim this is a good idea in particularly high dimensions is that volume in high dimensions is frankly a bit gross.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn53"><p>I, for one, love a sneaky transformation to spherical coordinates.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn54"><p>So why do all the technical shit to derive the PC prior when this option is just sitting there? Fuck you, that’s why.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn55"><p>This is sometimes called “automatic relevance determination” because words don’t have meaning anymore. Regardless, it’s a pretty sensible idea when you have a lot of covariates that can be quite different.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn56"><p>It is possible that a horseshoe-type prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog(%5Cell_j)"> would serve better, but there are going to be some issues as that will shrink the geometric mean of the length scales towards 1.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn57"><p>Part of the motivation for writing this was to actually have enough of the GP theory needed to think about these priors in a single place.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn58"><p>In fact, it’s isotropic, which is a stricter condition on most spaces. But there’s no real reason to specialise to isotropic processes so we simply won’t.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn59"><p>We are assuming that the mean is zero, but absent that assumption, we need to assume that the mean is constant.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn60"><p>For non-Gaussian processes, this property is known as <em>second-order</em> stationarity. For GPs this corresponds to strong stationary, which is a property of the distribution rather than the covariance function ↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn61"><p>If you’ve been exposed to the concept of ergodicity of random fields you may be eligible for compensation.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn62"><p>Possibly with different length scales in different directions or some other form of anisotropy↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn63"><p>This is normalisation is to make my life easier.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn68"><p>or a Cameron-Martin space↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn69"><p>That is, this measure bullshit isn’t just me pretending to be smart. It’s necessary.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn70"><p>Feeling annoyed by a reparameterisation this late in the blog post? Well tough. I’ve got to type this shit out and if I had to track all of those <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7B8%5Cnu%7D">s I would simply curl up and die.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn71"><p>In my whole damn life I have never successfully got the constant correct, so maybe check that yourself. But truly it does not matter. All that matters for the purposes of this post is the density as a function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Comega,%20%5Csigma,%5Ckappa)">.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn72"><p>This is not restricted to being Gaussian, but for all intents and porpoises it is.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn77"><p>This is the technical term for this type of function because mathematicians weren’t hugged enough as children.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn78"><p>for a particular value of “any”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn79"><p>for a particular value of “ordinary”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn80"><p>Well enough for a statistician anyway. You can look it up the details but if you desperately need to formalise it, you build an isomorphism between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7Bspan%7D%5C%7Bu(s),%20s%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%5C%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7Bspan%7D%5C%7Be%5E%7Bi%5Comega%5ETs%7D,%20s%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed%5C%7D"> and use that to construct <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?W">. It’s not <em>wildly</em> difficult but it’s also not actually interesting except for mathturbatory reasons.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn81"><p>Non-Gaussian!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn82"><p>On more spaces, the same construction still works. Just use whatever Fourier transform you have available.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn83"><p>or stochastic processes↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn84"><p>Yes, it’s a stochastic process over some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra of sets in my definition. <em>Sometimes</em> people use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctilde%7BZ%7D_%5Cnu(s)%20=%20Z_%5Cnu((-%5Cinfty,%20s_1%5D%5Ctimes%5Ccdots%20%5Ctimes%20(-%5Cinfty,%20s_d%5D)%0A"> as the spectral process and interpret the integrals as Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals. All power to them! So cute! It makes literally no difference and truly I do not think it makes anything easier. By the time you’re like “you know what, I reckon Stieltjes integrals are the way to go” you’ve left “easier” a few miles back. You’ve still got to come up with an appropriate concept of an integral.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn85"><p>Also known as the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space even though it doesn’t actually have to be one. This is the space of all means. See the previous GP blog.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn95"><p>Yes - this is Mercer’s theorem again. The only difference is that we are assuming that the eigenfunctions are the same for each <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> so they don’t need an index.↩︎</p></li>

<p>This is where Eliza—who knows a little something about monkeys—comes into frame: this did not gel with her experiences at all.</p>
<p>So Eliza (and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&amp;user=yg9U_okAAAAJ">Mark</a><sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>, who also knows a little something about monkeys) decided to look into it.</p>

<p>A big motivation for studying macaques and other non-human primates is that they’re good models of humans. This means that if there was solid evidence of macaques becoming less interested in novel stimuli as they age (while maintaining interest in people), this could suggest an evolutionary reason from this (commonly observed) behaviour in humans.</p>
<p>So if this result is true, it could help us understand the psychology of humans as they age (and in particular, the learned vs evolved trade off they are making).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-did-eliza-and-mark-do">So what did Eliza and Mark do?</h2>
<p>There are a few things you can do when confronted with a result that contradicts your experience: you can complain about it on the Internet, you can mobilize a direct replication effort, or you can conduct your own experiments. Eliza and Mark opted for the third option, designing a <em>conceptual replication</em>.</p>
<p>Direct replications tell you more about the specific experiment that was conducted, but not necessarily more about the phenomenon under investigation. In a study involving aged monkeys<sup>4</sup>, it’s difficult to imagine how a direct replication could take place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a conceptual replication has a lot more flexibility. It allows you to probe the question in a more targeted manner, appropriate for incremental science. In this case, Eliza and Mark opted to study only the claim that the monkeys lose interest in novel stimuli as they age (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.182237">paper here</a>). They did not look into the social claim. They also used a slightly different species of macaque (<em>M. mulatta</em> rather than <em>M. butterfly</em>). This is reasonable insofar as understanding macaques as a model for human behaviour.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-the-data-look-like">What does the data look like?</h2>
<p>The experiment used 243<sup>5</sup> monkeys aged between 4 and 30 and gave them a novel puzzle task (opening a fancy tube with food in it) for twenty minutes over two days. The puzzle was fitted with an activity tracker. Each monkey had two tries at the puzzle over two days. Monkeys had access to the puzzle for around<sup>6</sup> 20 minutes.</p>
<p>In order to match the original study’s analysis, Eliza and Mark divided the first two minutes into 15 second intervals and counted the number of intervals where the monkey interacted with the puzzle. They also measured the same thing over 20 minutes in order to see if there was a difference between short-term curiosity and more sustained exploration.</p>
<p>For each monkey, we have the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monkey ID</li>
<li>Age (4-30)</li>
<li>Day (one or two)</li>
<li>Number of active intervals in the first two minutes (0-8)</li>
<li>Number of active intervals in the first twenty minutes (0-80)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data and their analysis are freely<sup>7</sup> available <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1bj133v">here</a>.</p>

<p>Eliza and Mark’s monkey data is an example of a fairly common type of experimental data, where the same subject is measured multiple times. It is useful to break the covariates down into three types: <em>grouping variables</em>, <em>group-level covariates</em>, and <em>individual-level covariates</em>.</p>
<p><em>Grouping variables</em> indicate what <em>group</em> each observation is in. We will see a lot of different ways of defining groups as we go on, but a core idea is that observations within a group should conceptually more similar to each other than observations in different groups. For Eliza and Mark, their grouping variable is <code>monkey</code>. This encodes the idea that different monkeys might have very different levels of curiosity, but the same monkey across two different days would probably have fairly similar levels of curiosity.</p>
<p><em>Group-level covariates</em> are covariates that describe a feature of the <em>group</em> rather than the observation. In this example, <code>age</code> is a group-level covariate, because the monkeys are the same age at each observation.</p>
<p><em>Individual-level covariates</em> are covariates that describe a feature that is specific to an observation. (The nomenclature here can be a bit confusing: the “individual” refers to individual observations, not to individual monkeys. All good naming conventions go to shit eventually.) The individual-level covariate is experiment day. This can be a bit harder to see than the other designations, but it’s a little clearer if you think of it as an indicator of whether this is the first time the monkey has seen the task or the second time. Viewed this way, it is very clearly a measurement of an property of an observation rather than of a group.</p>
<p>Eliza and Mark’s monkey data is an example of a fairly general type of experimental data where subjects (our groups) are given the same task under different experimental conditions (described through individual-level covariates). As we will see, it’s not uncommon to have much more complex group definitions (that involve several grouping covariates) and larger sets of both group-level and individual-level covariates.</p>
<p>So how do we fit a model to this data.</p>

<p>The temptation with this sort of data is to fit a linear regression to it as a first model. In this case, we are using grouping, group-level, and individual-level covariates in the same way. Let’s suck it and see.</p>

<p>So the first thing you will notice is that that is <em>a lot</em> of regression coefficients! There are 243 monkeys and 2 days, but only 485 observations. This isn’t enough data to reliably estimate all of these parameters. (Look at the standard errors for the monkey-related coefficients. They are huge!)</p>
<p>So what are we to do?</p>
<p>The problem is the monkeys. If we use <code>monkey</code> as a factor variable, we only have (at most) two observations of each factor level. This is simply not enough observations per to estimate a different intercept for each monkey!</p>
<p>This type of model is often described as having <em>no pooling</em>, which indicates that there is no explicit dependence between the intercepts for each group (<code>monkey</code>). (There is some dependence between groups due to the group-level covariate <code>age</code>.)</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-we-ignore-the-monkeys-will-they-go-away-or-another-attempt-at-regression">If we ignore the monkeys, will they go away? or Another attempt at regression</h3>
<p>Our first attempt at a regression model didn’t work particularly well, but that doesn’t mean we should give up<sup>8</sup>. A second option is that we can assume that there is, fundamentally, no difference between monkeys. If all monkeys of the same age have similar amounts of interest in new puzzles, this would be a reasonable assumption. The best case scenario is that not accounting for differences between individual monkeys would still lead to approximately normal residuals, albeit with probably a larger residual variance.</p>
<p>This type of modelling assumption is called <em>complete pooling</em> as it pools the information between groups by treating them all as the same.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens in this case!</p>

<p>On the up side, the regression runs and doesn’t have too many parameters!</p>
<p>The brave and the bold might even try to interpret the coefficients and say something like <em>there doesn’t seem to be a strong effect of age</em>. But there’s real danger in trying to interpret regression coefficients in the presence of a potential confounder (in this case, the monkey ID). And it’s particularly bad form to do this without ever looking at any sort of regression diagnostics. Linear regression is not a magic eight ball.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the diagnostic plots.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-between-no-pooling-and-complete-pooling-multilevel-models-thats-what">What is between no pooling and complete pooling? Multilevel models, that’s what</h2>
<p>We are in a Goldilocks situation: no pooling results in a model that has too many independent parameters for the amount of data that we’ve got, while complete pooling has too few parameters to correctly account for the differences between the monkeys. So what is our perfectly tempered porridge<sup>9</sup>?</p>
<p>The answer is to assume that each monkey has its own intercept, but that it’s intercept can only be <em>so far</em> from the overall intercept (that we would’ve gotten from complete pooling). There are a bunch of ways to realize this concept, but the classical method is to use a normal distribution.</p>
<p>In particular, if the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th monkey has observations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_%7Bij%7D">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i=1,2">, then we can write our model as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ay_%7Bij%7D%20%20%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu_j%20+%20%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bage%7D%5C,%20%5Ctext%7Bage%7D_j%20+%20%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bday%7D%5C,%20%5Ctext%7Bday%7D_%7Bij%7D%20+%20%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bage,day%7D%5C,%20%5Ctext%7B%5Bage*day%5D%7D_%7Bij%7D,%20%5Csigma%5E2).%0A"></p>
<p>The effects of age and day and the data standard deviation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">) are just like they’d be in an ordinary linear regression model. Our modification comes in how we treat the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j">.</p>
<p>In a classical linear regression model, we would fit the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j">s independently, perhaps with some weakly informative prior distribution. But we’ve already discussed that that won’t work.</p>
<p>Instead we will make the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j"> <em>exchangeable</em> rather than independent. Exchangeability is a relaxation of the independence assumption to say instead encode that we have no idea which of the intercepts will do what. That is, if we switch around the labels of our intercepts the prior should not change. There is a long and storied history of exchangeable models in statistics, but the short version that is more than sufficient for our purposes is that they usually<sup>10</sup> take the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Cmu_j%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctau%20%5Cstackrel%7B%5Ctext%7Biid%7D%7D%7B%5Csim%7D%20&amp;p(%5Cmu_j%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctau),%20%5Cqquad%20i%20=%201,%5Cldots,%20J%20%5C%5C%0A%5Ctau%20%5Csim%20&amp;%20p(%5Ctau).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>In a regression context, we typically assume that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmu_j%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctau%20%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu,%20%5Ctau%5E2)%0A"> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> that will need their own priors.</p>
<p>We can explore this difference mathematically. The regression model, which assumes independence of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j">, uses <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cmu_1,%20%5Cldots,%20%5Cmu_J)%20=%20%5Cprod_%7Bj=1%7D%5EJ%20N(%5Cmu,%20%5Ctau_%5Ctext%7Bfixed%7D%5E2)%0A"> as the joint prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_1,%5Cldots,%5Cmu_J">. On the other hand, the exchangeable model, which forms the basis of multilevel models, assumes the joint prior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cmu_1,%20%5Cldots,%20%5Cmu_J)%20=%20%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cleft(%5Cprod_%7Bj=1%7D%5EJ%20N(%5Cmu,%20%5Ctau%5E2)%5Cright)p(%5Ctau)%5C,d%5Ctau,%0A"> for some prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctau)"> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">.</p>
<p>This might not seem like much of a change, but it can be quite profound. In both cases, the prior is saying that each <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j"> is, with high probability, at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%5Ctau"> away from the overall mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu">. The difference is that while the classical least squares formulation uses a fixed value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> that needs to be specified by the modeller, while the exchangeable model lets <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> adapt to the data.</p>
<p>This data adaptation is really nifty! It means that if the groups have similar means, they can borrow information from the other groups (via the narrowing of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">) in order to improve their precision over an unpooled estimate. On the other hand, if there is a meaningful difference between the groups<sup>11</sup>, this model can still represent that, unlike the unpooled model.</p>
<p>In our context, however, we need a tiny bit more. We have a <em>group-level covariate</em> (specifically <code>age</code>) that we think is going to effect the group mean. So the model we want is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ay_%7Bij%7D%20%20%5Cmid%20%5Cmu_j,%5Cbeta,%20%5Csigma%20&amp;%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu_j%20+%20%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bday%7D%5C,%20%5Ctext%7Bday%7D_%7Bij%7D%20+%20%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bage,day%7D%5C,%20%5Ctext%7B%5Bage*day%5D%7D_%7Bij%7D%20,%20%5Csigma%5E2)%20%5C%5C%0A%5Cmu_j%5Cmid%20%5Ctau,%20%5Cmu,%5Cbeta%20&amp;%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu%20+%20%20%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bage%7D%5C,%20%5Ctext%7Bage%7D_j,%20%5Ctau%5E2)%20%5C%5C%0A%5Cmu%20&amp;%5Csim%20p(%5Cmu)%5C%5C%0A%5Cbeta%20&amp;%5Csim%20p(%5Cbeta)%5C%5C%0A%5Ctau%20&amp;%20%5Csim%20p(%5Ctau)%20%5C%5C%0A%5Csigma%20&amp;%5Csim%20p(%5Csigma).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>In order to fully specify the model we need to set the four prior distributions.</p>
<p>This is an example of a <em>multilevel</em><sup>12</sup> <em>model</em>. The name comes from the data having multiple levels (in this case two: the observation level and the group level). Both levels have an appropriate model for their mean.</p>
<p>This mathematical representation does a good job in separating out the two different levels. However, there are a lot of other ways of writing multilevel models. An important example is the extended formula notation created<sup>13</sup> by R’s <code>lme4</code> package. In their notation, we would write this model as</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1">formula <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> active_bins_scaled <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">~</span> age_centred<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">*</span>day <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">+</span> (<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span> <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|</span> monkey)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first bit of this formula is the same as the formula used in linear regression. The interesting bit is is the <code>(1 | monkey)</code>. This is the way to tell R that the intercept (aka <code>1</code> in formula notation) is going to be grouped by <code>monkey</code> and we are going to put an exchangeable normal prior on it. For more complex models there are more complex variations on this theme, but for the moment we won’t go any further.</p>

<section id="reasoning-out-some-prior-distributions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reasoning-out-some-prior-distributions">Reasoning out some prior distributions</h2>
<p>We need to set priors. The canny amongst you may have noticed that I did not set priors in the previous two examples. There are two reasons for this: firstly I didn’t feel like it, and secondly none but the most terrible prior distributions would have meaningfully changed the conclusions. This is, it turns out, one of the great truths when it comes to prior distributions: <em>they do not matter until they do</em><sup>14</sup>.</p>
<p>In particular, if you have a parameter that <em>directly</em> sees the data (eg it’s in the likelihood) and there is nothing weird going on<sup>15</sup>, then the prior distribution will usually not do much as any prior will be quickly overwhelmed by the data.</p>
<p>The problem is that we have one parameter in our model (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">) that does not directly see the data. Instead of directly telling us about an observation, it tells us about how different the <em>groups</em> of observations are. There is usually less information in the data about this type of parameter and, consequently, the prior distribution will be more important. This is especially true when you have more than one grouping variable, or when a variable only has a small number of groups.</p>
<p>So let’s pay some proper attention to the priors.</p>
<p>To begin with, let’s set priors on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> (aka the data-level parameters). This is a <em>considerably</em> easier task if the data is scaled. Otherwise, you need to encode information about the usual scale<sup>16</sup> of the data into your priors. Sometimes this is a sensible and easy thing to do, but usually it’s easier to simply scale the data. (A lot of software will simply scale your data for you, but it is <em>always</em> better to do it yourself!)</p>
<p>So let’s scale our data. We have three variables that need scaling: <code>age</code> (aka the covariate that isn’t categorical) and <code>active_bins</code> (aka the response). For age, we are going to want to measure it as either <em>years from the youngest monkey</em> or <em>years from the average monkey</em>. I think, in this situation, the first version could make a lot of sense, but we are going with the second. This allows us to interpret <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> as the over-all mean. Otherwise, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> would tell us about the overall average activity of 4 year old monkeys and we will use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta(%5Ctext%7Bage%7D_j%20-%204)"> to estimate how much the activity changes, on average keeping all other aspects constant, as the monkey ages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have no sensible baseline for activity, so deviation from the average seems like a sensible scaling. I also don’t know, <em>a priori</em>, how variable activity is going to be, so I might want to scale<sup>17</sup> it by its standard deviation. In this case, I’m not going to do that because we have a sensible fixed<sup>18</sup> upper limit (8), which I can scale by.</p>
<p>One important thing here is that if we scale the data by data-dependent quantities (like the minimum, the mean, or the standard deviation) we <em>must</em> keep track of this information. This is because <em>any</em> future data we try to predict with this model will need to be transformed <em>the same way using the same</em><sup>19</sup> <em>numbers</em>! This particularly has implication when you are doing things like test/training set validation or cross validation: in the first case, the test set needs to be scaled in the same way the training set was; while in the second case each cross validation training set needs to be scaled independently and that scaling needs to be used on the corresponding left-out data<sup>20</sup>.</p>

</div>
<p>With our scaling completed, we can now start thinking about prior distributions. The trick with priors is to make them wide enough to cover all plausible values of a parameter without making them so wide that they put a whole bunch of weight on essentially silly values.</p>
<p>We know, for instance, that our unscaled activity will go between 0 and 8. That means that it’s unlikely for the mean of the scaled process to be much bigger than 3 or 4. These considerations, along with the fact that we have centred the data so the mean should be closer to zero, suggest that a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(0,1)"> prior should be appropriate for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu">.</p>
<p>As we normalised our age data relative to the smallest age, we should think more carefully about the scaling of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">. Macaques live for 20-30<sup>21</sup> years, so we need to think about, for instance, an ordinary aged macaque that would be 15 years older than the baseline. Thanks to our scaling, the largest change that we can have is around 1, which strongly suggests that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> was too much larger than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/8"> we are going to be in unreasonable territory. So let’s put a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(0,0.2%5E2)"> prior<sup>22</sup> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bage%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bage,day%7D">. For <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_%5Ctext%7Bday%7D"> we can use a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(0,1)"> prior.</p>
<p>Similarly, the scaling of <code>activity_bins</code> suggests that a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(0,1)"> prior would be sufficient for the data-level standard deviation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">.</p>
<p>That just leaves us with our choice of prior for the standard deviation of the intercept<sup>23</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Thankfully, we considered this case in detail <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-08-29-priors4/priors4.html">in the previous blog post</a>. There I argued that a sensible prior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> would be an exponential prior. To be quite honest with you, a half-normal or a half-t also would be fine. But I’m going to stick to my guns. For the scaling, again, it would be a touch surprising (given the scaling of the data) if the group means were more than 3 apart, so choosing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda=1"> in the exponential distribution should give a relatively weak prior without being so wide that we are putting prior mass on a bunch of values that we would never actually want to put prior mass on.</p>
<p>We can then fit the model with <code>brms</code>. In this case, I’m using the <code>cmdstanr</code> back end, because it’s fast and I like it.</p>
<p>To specify the model, we use the <code>lme4</code>-style formula notation discussed above.</p>
<p>To set the priors, we will use <code>brms</code>. Now, if you are Paul you might be able to remember how to set priors in <code>brms</code> without having to look it up, but I am sadly not Paul<sup>24</sup>, so every time I need to set priors in <code>brms</code> I write the formula and use the convenient <code>get_prior</code> function</p>

<p>From this, we can see that the default prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> is an improper flat prior, the default prior on the intercept is a Student-t with 3 degrees of freedom centred at zero with standard deviation 2.5. The same prior (restricted to positive numbers) is put on all of the standard deviation parameters. These default prior distributions are, to be honest, probably fine in this context<sup>25</sup>, but it is good practice to always set your prior.</p>
<p>We do this as follows. (Note that <code>brms</code> uses Stan, which parameterises the normal distribution by its mean and <em>standard deviation</em>!)</p>

<p>So we have specified some priors using the power of <em>our thoughts</em>. But we should probably check to see if they are broadly sensible. A great thing about Bayesian modelling is that we are explicitly specifying our <em>a priori</em> (or pre-data) assumptions about the data generating process. That means that we can do a fast validation of our priors by simulating from them and checking that they’re not too wild.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to do this, but the easiest<sup>26</sup> way to do this is to use the <code>sample_prior = "only"</code> option in the <code>brm()</code> function.</p>

<p>The vertical lines are (approximately) the minimum and maximum of the data. This<sup>28</sup> suggests that the implied priors are definitely wider than our observed data, but they are not several orders of magnitude too wide. This is a good situation to be in: it gives enough room in the priors that we might be wrong with our specification while also not allowing for truly wild values of the parameters (and implied predictive distribution). One could even go so far as to say that the prior is weakly informative.</p>
<p>Let’s compare this to the default priors on the standard deviation parameters. (The default priors on the regression parameters are improper so we can’t simulate from them. So I replaced the improper prior with a much narrower <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(0,10%5E2)"> prior. If you make the prior on the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> wider the prior predictive distribution also gets wider.)</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be much of an effect of age in this data.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, this matches well<sup>29</sup> with the output of <code>lme4</code>, which is a nice sense check for simple models. Generally speaking, if they’re the same then they’re both fine. If they are different<sup>30</sup>, then you’ve got to look deeper.</p>

<p>We can also compare the fit using leave-one-out cross validation. This is similar to AIC, but more directly interpretable.

This average is sometimes called the <em>expected log predictive density</em> or elpd.</p>
<p>To compare it with the two linear regression models, I need to fit them in <code>brms</code>. I will use a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(0,1)"> prior for the monkey intercepts and the same priors as the previous model for the other parameters.</p>

<p>Of course, we would be fools to just assume that because we fit a model and compared it to some other models, the model is a good representation of the data. To do that, we need to look at some posterior checks.</p>

<p>That appears to be a reasonably good fit, although it’s possible that the prediction intervals are a bit wide. We can also look at the plot of the posterior residuals vs the fitted values. Here the fitted values are the mean of the posterior predictive distribution.</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be any obvious evidence of non-linearity in the residuals, which suggests the linear model for age was sufficient.</p>
<p>We can also check the distributional assumption<sup>31</sup> that the residuals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar_%7Bij%7D%20=%20y_%7Bij%7D%20-%20%5Cmu_j%0A"> have a Gaussian distribution.

<p>That’s not too bad. A bit of a deviation from normality in the tails but nothing that would make me weep. It could well be an artifact of how I defined and normalised the residuals.</p>
<p>We can also look at the so-called k-hat plot, which can be useful for finding high-leverage observations in general models.</p>

<p>This suggests that observations 393, 394 are potentially high leverage and we should check them more carefully. I won’t be doing that today.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s look at the residuals vs the fitted values. This is a commonly used diagnostic plot in linear regression and it can be very useful for visually detecting non-linear patterns and heteroskedasticity in the residuals. So let’s make the plot<sup>32</sup>.</p>

<p>Hmmmm. That’s not <em>excellent</em>. The stripes are related to the 8 distinct values the response can take, but there is definitely a trend in the residuals. In particular, we are under-predicting small values and over-predicting large values. <em>There is something here and we will look into it</em>!</p>

<section id="understanding-diagnostic-plots-from-multilevel-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-diagnostic-plots-from-multilevel-models">Understanding diagnostic plots from multilevel models</h2>
<p>The thing is, multilevel models are notorious for having patterns that are essentially a product of the data design and not of any type of statistical misspecification. In a really great paper that you should all read, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06988.pdf">Adam Loy, Heike Hofmann, and Di Cook</a> talk extensively about the challenges with interpreting diagnostic plots for linear mixed effects models<sup>33</sup>.</p>
<p>I’m not going to fully follow their recommendations, mostly because I’m too lazy<sup>34</sup> to write a for loop, but I am going to appropriate the guts of their idea.</p>
<p>They note that strange patterns can occur in diagnostic plots <em>even for correctly specified models</em>. Moreover, we simply do not know what these patters will be. It’s too complex a function of the design, the structure, the data, and the potential misspecification. That sounds bad, but they note that <em>we don’t need to know what pattern to expect</em>. Why not? Because we can simulate it!</p>
<p>So this is the idea: Let’s simulate some fake<sup>35</sup> data from a correctly specified model that otherwise matches with our data. We can then compare the diagnostic plots from the fake data with diagnostic plots from the real data and see if the patterns are meaningfully different.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we should have a method to construct <em>multiple</em> fake data sets. Why? Well a plot is nothing but another test statistic and we <em>must</em> take this variability into account.</p>
<p>(That said, do what I say, not what I do. This is a blog. I’m not going to code well enough to make this clean and straightforward, so I’m just going to do one.)</p>
<p>There is an entire theory of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2009.0120"><em>visual inference</em></a> that uses these lineups of diagnostic plots, where one uses the real data and the rest use realisations of the null data, that is really quite interesting and <em>well</em> beyond the scope of this post. But if you want to know more, read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06988.pdf">Low, Hoffman, and Cook</a> paper!</p>
<section id="making-new-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-new-data">Making new data</h3>
<p>The first thing that we need to do is to work out how to simulate fake data from a correctly specified model with the same structure. Following the Low etc paper, I’m going to do a simple parameteric bootstrap, where I take the posterior medians of the fitted distribution and simulate data from them.</p>
<p>That said, there are a bunch of other options. Specifically, we have a whole bag of samples from our posterior distribution and it would be possible to use that to select values of<sup>36</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Cmu,%20%5Cbeta,%20%5Ctau,%20%5Csigma)"> for our simulation.</p>
<p>So let’s make some fake data and fit the model to it!</p>

<p>And look: we get some extreme values. (Depending on the run we get more or less). This suggests that while it would be useful to look at the data points flagged by the k-hat statistic, it may just be sampling variation.;</p>

<p>And what do you know! They look the same. (Well, minus the discretisation artefacts.)</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-the-hell-is-going-on">So what the hell is going on?</h3>
<p>Great question! It turns out that this is one of those cases where our intuition from linear models <em>does not</em> transfer over to multilevel models.</p>
<p>We can actually reason this out by thinking about a model where we have no covariates.</p>
<p>If we have no pooling then the observations for every monkey are, essentially, averaged to get our estimate of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j">. If we repeat this, we will find that our <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j"> are basically<sup>37</sup> unbiased and the corresponding residual <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar_%7Bij%7D%20=%20y_%7Bij%7D%20-%20%5Cmu_j%0A"> will have mean zero.</p>
<p>But that’s not what happens when we have partial pooling. When we have partial pooling we are <em>combining</em> our naive average<sup>38</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%20y_j"> with the global average <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> in a way that accounts for the size of group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> relative to other groups as well as the within-group variability relative to the between-group variability.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Expand for maths. Just a little
</summary>
There is, in fact, a formula for it. Just in case you’re a formula sort of person. The posterior estimate for a Gaussian multilevel model with an intercept but no covariates is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%20+%5Cfrac%7B%5Csigma%5E2/n%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D%7D%5Cleft(%5Cbar%7By%7D_j%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csigma%5E2/n%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D%20%5Cmu%5Cright).%0A"> When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma/%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D"> is small, which happens when the sampling standard deviation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%20y_j"> is small relative to the between group variation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">, this is almost equal to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%7By%7D_j"> and there is almost no pooling. On the other hand, when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma/%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D"> is large relative to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">, then the estimate of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j"> will be very close to the overall mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu">.
</details>
<p>The short version is that there is some magical number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha">, which depends on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_j"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Chat%20%5Cmu_j%20=%20%5Calpha%20%5Cbar%7By%7D_j%20+%20(1-%5Calpha)%20%5Cmu.%0A"> Because of this, the residuals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar_%7Bij%7D%20=%20y_j%20-%20%5Calpha%20%5Cbar%7By_j%7D%20-%20(1-%5Calpha)%5Cmu%0A"> are suddenly <em>not</em> going to have mean zero.</p>
<p>In fact, if we think about it a bit more, we will realise that the model will drag extreme groups to the centre, which accounts for the positive slope in the residuals vs the fitted values.</p>
<p>The slope in this example is quite extreme because the groups are very small (only one or two individuals). But it is a general phenomenon and it’s discussed extensively in Chapter 7 of <a href="http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~hodges/RPLMBook/RPLMBookpage.htm">Jim Hodges’ excellent book</a>. His suggestion is that there isn’t really a good, general way to remove the trend. But that doesn’t mean the plot is useless. It is still able to pinpoint outliers and heteroskedasticity. You’ve just got to tilt your head.</p>
<p>But for the purposes of today we can notice that there don’t seem to be any extreme outliers so everything is probably ok.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So what have we done? Well we’ve gone through the process of fitting and scruitinising a simple Bayesian multilevel model. We’ve talked about some of the challenges associated with graphical diagnostics for structured data. And we’ve all<sup>39</sup> learnt something about the residual-vs-fitted plot for a multilevel model.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we’ve all learnt the value of using fake data simulated from the posterior model to help us understand our diagnostics.</p>
<p>There is more to the scientific story here. It turns out that while there is no effect over 2 minutes, there is <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200316">a slight effect over 20 minutes</a>. So the conceptual replication failed, but still found some interesting things.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve ignored one big elephant in the room: That data was discrete. In the end, our distributional diagnostics didn’t throw up any massive red flags, but nevertheless it could be an interesting exercise to see what happens if we use a more problem-adapted likelihood.</p>
<p>Last, and certainly not least, I barely scratched the surface<sup>40</sup> of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06988.pdf">Loy, Hoffman, and Cook</a> paper. Anyone who is interested in fitting Gaussian multilevel models should definitely give it a read.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Mark insisted that I like to his google scholar rather than his website. He’s cute that way.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Mark wants me to tell you that he’s not vain he’s just moving. Sure Jan.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>I know that marmosets suffer from lesbian bed death, but I’m told that a marmoset is not a macaque, which in turn is not a macaw. Ecology is fascinating.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>A real problem in the world is that there aren’t enough monkeys for animal research at the best of times. Once you need aged monkeys, it’s an even smaller population. Non-human primate research is <em>hard</em>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Actually 244, but one of them turned out to be blind. Animal research is a journey.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>It turns out that some of the monkeys didn’t want to give up the puzzle after 20 minutes. One held out for 72 minutes before the data collection ended. Cheeky monkeys.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Did Mark make me do unspeakable, degrading, borderline immoral things to get the data? No.&nbsp;It’s open source. Truly the first time I’ve been disappointed that something was open source.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>If statisticians abandoned linear regression we would have nothing left. We would be desiccated husks propping up the bar at 3am talking about how we used to do loads of lines in the 80s.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Our perfect amount of pool? I don’t know how metaphors work↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>They <em>always</em> take this form if there is a countable collection of exchangeable random variables. For a finite set there are a few more options. But no one talks about those.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>monkeys↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Also known as a mixed effects or a linear mixed effects model.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>There are <em>many</em> other ways to represnt Gaussian multilevel models. My former colleague Emi Tanaka and Francis Hui wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08628">great paper</a> on this topic.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Some particularly bold and foolish people take this to mean that priors aren’t important. They usually get their arse handed to them the moment they try to fit an even mildly complex model.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>A non-exhaustive set of weird things: categorical regressors with a rare category, tail parameters, mixture models↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>There are situations where this is not true. For instance if you have a log or logit link function you can put reasonable bounds on your coefficients regardless of the scaling of your data. That said, the computational procedures <em>always</em> appreciate a bit of scaling. If there’s one thing that computers hate more that big numbers it’s small numbers.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Of course, we know that the there are only 8 fifteen second intervals in two minutes, so we could use this information to make a data-independent scaling. To be brutally francis with you, that’s what you should probably do in this situation, but I’m trying to be pedagogical so let’s at least think about scaling it by the standard deviation.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Fixed scaling is always easier than data-dependent scaling↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>A real trick for young players is scaling new data by the mean and standard deviation of the new data rather than the old data. That’s a very subtle bug that can be <em>very</em> hard to squash.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>The <code>tidymodels</code> package in R is a great example of an ecosystem that does this properly. <a href="https://www.tmwr.org">Max and Julia’s book</a> on using <code>tidymodels</code> is very excellent and well worth a read.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>Of all of the things in this post, this has been the most aggressively fact checked one↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>In prior width and on grindr, you should always expect that he’s rounding up.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>In some places, we would call this a random effect.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>He is very lovely. Many people would prefer that I was him.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>It’s possible the the prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> might be too wide. If we were doing a logistic regression, these priors would definitely be too wide. And if we had a lot of different random terms (eg if we had lots of different species or lots of different labs) then they would also probably be too wide. But they are better than not having priors.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>Not the most computationally efficient, but the easiest. Also because it’s the same code we will later use to fit the model, we are evaluating the priors that are actually used and not the ones that we think we’re using.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p> It’s number 88, but because our prior is exchangeable it does not matter which monkey we do this for!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>I also checked different values of <code>age</code> as well as looking at the posterior mean (via <code>posterior_epred</code>) and the conclusions stay the same.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>The numbers will never be exactly equal, but they are of similar orders of magnitude.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>Or if you get some sort of error or warning from <code>lme4</code>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>So there’s a wrinkle here. Technically, all of the residuals have different variances, which is annoying. You typically studentise them using the leverage scores, but this is a touch trickier for multilevel models. Chapter 7 of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=richly+parametrized+linear+models&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Jim Hodges’s excellent book</a> contains a really good discussion.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>Once again, we are not studentizing the residuals. I’m sorry.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>Another name for a multilevel model with a Gaussian response↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>Also because all of my data plots are gonna be stripey as hell, and that kinda destroys the point of visual inference.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>They call it <em>null data</em>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>Note that I am <em>not</em> using values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j">! I will simulate those from the normal distribution to ensure correct model specification. For the same reason, I am not using a residual bootstrap. The aim here is not to assess uncertainty so much as it is to ↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>This is a bit more complex when you’re Bayesian, but the intuition still holds. The difference is that now it is asymptotic↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>This is the average of all observations in group j. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbar%20y_j%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn_j%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bn_j%7D%20y_%7Bij%7D.%0A">↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>I mean, some of us knew this. Personally, I only remembered after I saw it and swore a bit.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>In particular, they have an interesting discussion on assessing the distributional assumption for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_j">.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>Priors part 4: Specifying priors that appropriately penalise complexity</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>At some point in the distant past, I wrote three posts about prior distributions. The <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-10-14-priors1/priors1.html">first</a> was very basic, because why not. The <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-10-14-priors2/priors2.html">second</a> one talked about conjugate priors. The <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-10-15-priors3/priors3.html">third</a> one talked about so-called objective priors.</p>
<p>I am suddenly<sup>1</sup> of a mood to write some more on this<sup>2</sup> topic.</p>
<p>The thing is, so far I’ve only really talked about methods for setting prior distributions that I don’t particularly care for. Fuck that. Let’s talk about things I like. There is enough negative energy<sup>3</sup> in the world.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about priors. But the good stuff. The aim is to give my answer to the question “how should you set a prior distribution?”.</p>
<section id="bro-do-you-even-know-what-a-parameter-is" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bro-do-you-even-know-what-a-parameter-is">Bro do you even know what a parameter is?</h2>
<p>You don’t. No one does. They’re not real.</p>
<p>Parameters are polite fictions that we use to get through the day. They’re our weapons of mass destruction. They’re the magazines we only bought for the articles. They are our girlfriends who live in Canada<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>One way we can see this is to ask ourselves a simple<sup>5</sup>: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ay_i%20%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BNegative-Binomial%7D(%5Cmu,%20%5Calpha),%20%5Cqquad%20i%20=%201,%5Cldots,%20n%5Ctext%7B?%7D%0A"></p>
<p>The answer<sup>6</sup> <sup>7</sup> would be two.</p>
<p>But let me ask a different question. How many parameters are there in this model<sup>8</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ay_i%5Cmid%20u_i%20&amp;%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BPoisson%7D(%5Cmu%20u_i)%20%5C%5C%0Au_i%20&amp;%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BGamma%7D(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D,%20%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D),%5Cqquad%20i=1,%5Cldots,%20n%5Ctext%7B?%7D%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>One answer to this question would be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n+2">. In this interpretation of the question everything in the model that isn’t directly observed is a parameter.</p>
<p>But there is another view.</p>
<p>Mathematically, these two models are equivalent. That is, if you marginalise<sup>9</sup> out the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"> you get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5CPr(y=k)%20&amp;=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmu%5Ek%5Calpha%5E%7B-1/%5Calpha%7D%7D%7B%5CGamma(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%5CGamma(k+1)%7D%20%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20u%5Ek%20e%5E%7B-%5Cmu%20u%7D%20u%5E%7B1/%5Calpha-1%7De%5E%7B-u/%5Calpha%7D%5C,du%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmu%5Ek%5Calpha%5E%7B-1/%5Calpha%7D%7D%7B%5CGamma(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%5CGamma(k+1)%7D%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20u%5E%7Bk%20+%201/%5Calpha-1%7De%5E%7B-(%5Cmu%20+%20%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)u%7D%5C,du%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmu%5Ek%5Calpha%5E%7B-1/%5Calpha%7D%7D%7B%5CGamma(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%5CGamma(k+1)%7D%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B%5Cmu+%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D%7D%5Cright)%5E%7Bk%20+%201/%5Calpha-1%7De%5E%7B-t%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cmu%20+%20%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D%7D%5C,dt%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%5Cfrac%7B%5CGamma(k%20+%20%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%7D%7B%5CGamma(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%5CGamma(k+1)%7D%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmu%7D%7B%5Cmu%20+%20%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D%7D%5Cright)%5Ek%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D%7D%7B%5Cmu%20+%20%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B1/%5Calpha%7D%20.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> This is <em>exactly</em> the negative binomial distribution with mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu(1%20+%20%5Calpha%20%5Cmu)">.</p>
<p>So maybe there are two parameters.</p>
<p>Does it make a difference? Sometimes. For instance, if you were following ordinary practice in Bayesian machine learning, you would (approximately) marginalise out <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Cmu,%20%5Clambda)"> in the first model, but in the second model you’d probably treat them as tuning hyper-parameters<sup>10</sup> in the second and optimise<sup>11</sup> over them.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the second model we can ask <em>what other priors could we put on the</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"><em>?</em>. There is no equivalent question for the first model. This could be useful, for instance, if we believe that the overdispersion may differ among population groups. It is considerably easier to extend the random effects formulation into a multilevel model.</p>
<p>Ok. So it doesn’t really matter too much. It really depends on what you’re going to do with the model when you’re breaking your model into <em>things that we need to set priors for</em> and <em>things where the priors are a structural part of the model</em>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to set prior distributions. I’ve covered some in previous posts and there are certainly more. But today I’m going to focus on one constructive method that I’m particular fond of: <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-1/Penalising-Model-Component-Complexity--A-Principled-Practical-Approach-to/10.1214/16-STS576.full">penalised complexity priors</a>.</p>
<p>These priors fall out from a certain way of seeing parameters. The idea is that some parameters in a model function as <em>flexibility parameters</em>. These naturally have a base value, which corresponds to the simplest model that they index. I’ll refer to the distribution you get when the parameter takes its base value as the <em>base model</em>.</p>
<div id="exm-neg-binom" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 1 (Overdispersion of a negative binomial) </strong></span>The negative binomial distribution has two parameters: a mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and an overdispersion parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha"> so the variance is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu(1%20+%20%5Calpha%20%5Cmu)">. The mean parameter is <em>not</em> a flexibility parameter. Conceptually, changing the mean<sup>12</sup> does not make a distribution more or less complex, it simply shuttles it around.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the overdispersion parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha"> <em>is</em> a flexibility parameter. It’s special value is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20=0">, which corresponds to a Poisson distribution, which is the base model for the negative binomial distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="exm-student-t" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 2 (Student-t degrees of freedom) </strong></span>The three parameter student-t distribution has density (parameterised by its standard deviation assuming <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20%3E%202">!) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Cmu,%20%5Csigma,%20%5Cnu)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CGamma%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnu%20+%201%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright)%7D%7B%5Csigma%5Cnu%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B%5Cnu-2%7D%7D%20%5CGamma%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnu%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright)%7D%5Cleft(1%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnu-2%7D%7B%5Cnu%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7By%20-%20%5Cmu%7D%7B%5Csigma%7D%5Cright)%5E2%7D%7B%5Cnu%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnu+1%7D%7B2%7D%7D,%20%5Cqquad%20%5Cnu%20%3E%202.%0A"> This has mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2">. The slightly strange parameterisation and the restriction to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%3E0"> is useful because it lets us specify a prior on the <em>variance</em> itself and not some parameter that is the variance divided by some function<sup>13</sup> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">.</p>
<p>The natural base model here is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(%5Cmu,%20%5Csigma%5E2)">, which corresponds to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20=%20%5Cinfty">.</p>

<div id="exm-gaussian" class="theorem example">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Example 3 (Variance of a Gaussian random effect) </strong></span>A Gaussian distribution has two parameters: a mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and a standard deviation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Once again, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> is not a flexibility parameter, but in some circumstances <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> can be.</p>
<p>To see this, imagine that we have a simple random intercept model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ay_%7Bij%7D%20%5Cmid%20u_j%20&amp;%5Csim%20N(u_j,%20%5Csigma%5E2),%5Cqquad%20i=1,%5Cldots,n,%20j%20=1,%5Cldots,J%20%5C%5C%0Au_j%20&amp;%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu,%20%5Ctau).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> In this case, we don’t really view <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> as a flexibility parameter, but <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> is. Why the distinction? Well let’s think about what happens at special value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0">.</p>
<p>When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20=%200"> we are saying that there is no variability in the data if we know the corresponding <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i">. This is, frankly, quite weird and it’s not necessarily a base model we would believe<sup>14</sup> in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%20=0">, then we are say that all of the groups have the same mean. This is a useful and interesting base model that could absolutely happen in most data. So we say that while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> isn’t necessarily a flexibility parameter in the model, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> definitely is.</p>
<p>In this case the base model is the degenerate distribution<sup>15</sup> where the mean of each group is equal to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu">.</p>
</div>
<p>The second example shows that the idea of a flexibility parameter is deeply contextual. Once again, we run into the idea that Statistical Arianism<sup>16</sup> is bad. <em>Parameters and their prior distributions can only be fully understood if you know their context within the entire model.</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sure-youre-flexible-but-lets-not-over-do-the-dutch-wink">Sure you’re flexible, but let’s not over-do the Dutch wink</h2>
<p>Now that we have the concept of a flexibility parameter, let’s think about how we should use it. In particular, we should ask exactly what we want our prior to do. In <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-1/Penalising-Model-Component-Complexity--A-Principled-Practical-Approach-to/10.1214/16-STS576.full">the paper</a> we listed 8 things that we want the prior to do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The prior should contain information<sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup> <sup>19</sup></li>
<li>The prior should be aware of model structure</li>
<li>If we move our model to a new application, it should be clear how we can change the information contained in our prior. We can do this by <em>explicitly</em> including specific information in the prior.</li>
<li>The prior should limit<sup>20</sup> the flexibility of an overparameterised model</li>
<li>Restrictions of the prior to identifiable sub-manifolds<sup>21</sup> of the parameter space should be sensible.</li>
<li>The prior should be specified to control what a parameter <em>does</em> in the context<sup>22</sup> of the model (rather than its numerical value)</li>
<li>The prior should be computationally<sup>23</sup> feasible</li>
<li>The prior should perform well<sup>24</sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These desiderata are <em>aspirational</em> and I in no way claim that we successfully satisfied them. But we tried. And we came up with a pretty useful proposal.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: if our model has a flexibility parameter we should put a prior on it that <em>penalises the complexity</em> of the model. That is, we want most of the prior mass to be near<sup>25</sup> the base value.</p>
<p>In practice, we try to do this by penalising the complexity of each <em>component</em> of a model. For instance, consider the following model for a flexible regression: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ay_i%20%5Cmid%20f,%20u_i%20&amp;%5Csim%20N(u_i%20+f(z_i),%20%5Csigma%5E2)%20%5C%5C%0Af%20&amp;%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BSmoothing-spline%7D(%5Clambda)%5C%5C%0Au_i%20&amp;%5Csim%20N(%20%5Cmu%20+%20x_i%5ET%5Cbeta%20,%20%5Ctau%5E2).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> The exact definition<sup>26</sup> of a smoothing spline that we are using is not wildly important, but it is specified<sup>27</sup> by a smoothing parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda">, and when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda=%5Cinfty"> we get our base model (a function that is equal to zero everywhere). This model has two components (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">) and they each have one smoothing parameter (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda">, with base model at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%20%5Cinfty">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">, with base model at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%20=%200">).</p>
<p>The nice thing about splitting a model up into components and building priors for each component is that we can build generic priors for each component that can be potentially be tuned to make them appropriate for the global model. Is this a perfect way to realise our second aim? No.&nbsp;But it’s an ok place to start<sup>28</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-speed-of-a-battered-sav-proximity-to-the-base-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-speed-of-a-battered-sav-proximity-to-the-base-model">The speed of a battered sav: proximity to the base model</h2>
<p>Ok. So you’re Brad Pitt. Wait. No.</p>
<p>Ok. So we need to build a prior that penalises complexity by putting most of its prior mass near the base model. In order to do this we need to first specify what we mean by <em>near</em>.</p>
<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of things that we could mean. The easiest choice would be to just use the natural distance from the base model in the parameter space. But this isn’t necessarily a good idea. Firstly, it falls flat when the base model is at infinity. But more importantly, it violates our 6th aim by ignoring the context of the parameter and just setting a prior on its numerical value.</p>
<p>So instead we are going to parameterise distance by asking ourselves a simple question: for a component with flexibility parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi">, how much more complex would our model component be if we used the value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi"> instead of the base value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi_%5Ctext%7Bbase%7D">?</p>
<p>We can measure this complexity using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or KL divergence if you’re nasty) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(f%20%7C%7C%20g)%20=%20%5Cint_%5CTheta%20f(t)%20%5Clog%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bf(t)%7D%7Bg(t)%7D%5Cright)%5C,dt.%0A"> This is a quantity from information theory that directly measures how much information would be lost<sup>29</sup> if we replaced the more complex model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> with the simpler model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g">. The more information that would be lost, the more complex <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> is relative to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g">.</p>
<p>While the Kullback-Leibler divergence looks a bit intimidating the first time you see it, it’s got a lot of nice properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s always non-negative.</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn’t depend on how you parameterise the distribution. If you do a smooth, invertible change of variables to both distribution the KL divergence remains unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s related to the information matrix and the Fisher distance. In particular, let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20%5Cxi)"> be a family of distributions parameterised by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi">. Then, near <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi_0">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(f(%5Ccdot%20%5Cmid%20%5Cxi_0%20+%5Cdelta)%20%20%7C%7C%20f(%5Ccdot%20%5Cmid%20%5Cxi_0))%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cdelta%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%20I(%5Cxi_0)%20+%20o(%5Cdelta%5E2),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I(%5Cxi)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(%5Clog%20p(f(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Cxi))%5E2)"> is the Fisher information. The quantity on the right hand side is the square of a distance from the base model.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be related to the total variation distance<sup>30</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7Cf%20-%20g%5C%7C_%5Ctext%7BTV%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(f%20%7C%7C%20g)%7D.%0A"></p></li>
</ul>
<p>But it also has some less charming properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The KL divergence is <em>not</em> a distance!</li>
<li>The KL divergence is <em>not</em> symmetric, that is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(f%20%7C%7C%20g)%20%5Cneq%20%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(g%20%7C%7C%20f)"></li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these properties is irrelevant to us. The second interesting. I’d argue that it is an advantage. We can think in an analogy: if your base model is a point at the bottom of a valley, there is a big practical difference between how much effort it takes to get from the base model to another model that is on top of a hill compared to the amount of effort it takes to go in the other direction. This type of asymmetry is relevant to us: it’s easier for data to tell a simple model that it should be more complex than it is to tell a complex model to be simpler. We want our prior information to somewhat even this out, so we put less prior mass on models that are more complex and more on models that are more complex.</p>
<p>There is one more little annoyance: if you look at the two distance measures that the KL divergence is related to, you’ll notice that in both cases, the KL divergence is related to the <em>square</em> of the distance and not the distance itself.</p>
<p>If we use the KL divergence itself as a distance proxy, it will increase too sharply<sup>31</sup> and we may end up over-penalising. To that end, we use the following “distance” measure <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ad(%5Cxi)%20=%20%5Csqrt%7B2%20%5Coperatorname%7BKL%7D(f(%5Ccdot%20%5Cmid%20%5Cxi)%20%7C%7C%20f(%5Ccdot%20%5Cmid%20%5Cxi_0))%7D.%0A"> If you’re wondering about that 2, it doesn’t really matter but it makes a couple of things ever so slightly cleaner down the road.</p>

<p>Now, you will notice that as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b%5Crightarrow%200"> the KL divergence heads off to infinity.

This is not legally the same thing as having one for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b=0">, but it is morally the same.</p>
<p>With this, we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ad(%5Calpha)%20=%20%5Csqrt%7B2%5Clog(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%20-%202%5Cpsi(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%20%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>If the digamma function is a bit too hardcore for you, the <a href="https://functions.wolfram.com/GammaBetaErf/PolyGamma/06/02/">approximation</a> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cpsi(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%20=%20%5Clog(%5Calpha%5E%7B-1%7D)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha%7D%7B2%7D%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(%5Calpha%5E2)%0A"> gives the approximate distance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ad(%5Calpha)%20%5Capprox%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Calpha%7D.%0A"> That is, the distance we are using is approximately the <em>standard deviation</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i">.</p>

We do this through the change of variables formula <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap_%5Cxi(%5Cxi)%20=%20p_d(d(%5Cxi))%5Cleft%7C%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd%5Cxi%7D%20d(%5Cxi)%5Cright%7C,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_d(%5Ccdot)"> is the prior density for the distance parameterisation</p>
<p>But which prior should we use on the distance? A good default choice is a prior that penalises at a constant rate. That is, we want <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7Bp_d(d%20+%20%5Cdelta)%7D%7Bp_d(d)%7D%20=%20r%5E%7B%5Cdelta%7D%0A"> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%3Cr%3C1">. This condition says that the rate at which the density decreases does not change as we move through the parameter space. This is extremely useful because any other (monotone) distribution is going to have a point at which the bulk changes to the tail. As we are putting our prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">, we won’t necessarily be able to reason about this point.</p>
<p>Constant-rate penalisation implies that the prior on the distance scale is an exponential distribution and, hence, we get our generic PC prior for a flexibility parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cxi)%20=%20%5Clambda%20e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%20d(%5Cxi)%7D%5Cleft%7C%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd%5Cxi%7D%20d(%5Cxi)%5Cright%7C.%0A"></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="closing-the-door-how-to-choose-lambda">Closing the door: How to choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"></h2>
<p>The big unanswered question is how do we choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda">. The scaling of a prior distribution is <em>vital</em> to its success, so this is an important question.</p>
<p>And I will just say this: work it out your damn self.</p>
<p>The thing about prior distributions that shamelessly include information is that, at some point, you need to include<sup>36</sup> some information. And there is no way for anyone other than the data analyst to know what the information to include is.</p>
<p>But I can outline a general procedure.</p>
<p>Imagine that for your flexibility parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi"> you have some interpretable transformation of it <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Cxi)">. For instance if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cxi%20=%20%5Csigma%5E2">, then a good choice for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ccdot)"> would be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Csigma%5E2)=%5Csigma">. This is because standard deviations are on the same scale as the observations<sup>37</sup>, and we have intuition about that happens one standard deviation from the mean.</p>
<p>We then use problem-specific information can help us set a natural scale for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Cxi)">. We do this by choosing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(Q(%5Cxi)%20%3E%20U)%20=%20%5Calpha%0A"> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U">, which we would consider large<sup>38</sup> for our problem, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%3C%5Calpha%3C1">.</p>
<p>From the properties of the exponential distribution, we can see that we can satisfy this if we choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clambda%20=%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog(%5Calpha)%7D%7Bd%5E%7B-1%7D(Q%5E%7B-1%7D(U))%7D.%0A"> This can be found numerically if it needs to be.</p>
<p>The simplest case is the standard deviation of the normal distribution, because in this case <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Csigma)%20=%20%5Csigma"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%5E%7B-1%7D(Q%5E%7B-1%7D(U))%20=%20U">. In general, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20%5Csigma%20R)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> is not a correlation matrix, you should take into account the diagonal of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> when choosing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q">. For instance, choosing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q"> to be the geometric mean<sup>39</sup> of the marginal variances of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"> is a good idea!</p>
<p>When a model has more than one component, or a component has more than one flexibility parameter, it can be the case that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ccdot)"> depends on multiple parameters. For instance, if I hadn’t reparameterised the Student-t distribution to have variance independent of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">, a PC prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> would have a quantity of interest that depends on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">. We will also see this if I ever get around to writing about priors for Gaussian processes.</p>

<section id="the-dream-pc-priors-in-practice" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dream-pc-priors-in-practice">The Dream: PC priors in practice</h2>
<p>Thus we can put together a PC prior as the unique prior that follows the following four principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Occam’s razor: We have a base model that represents simplicity and we prefer our base model.</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring complexity: We define the prior using the square root of the KL divergence between the base model and the more flexible model. The square root ensures that the divergence is on a similar scale to a distance, but we maintain the asymmetry of the divergence as as a feature (not a bug).</p></li>
<li><p>Constant penalisation: We use an exponential prior on the distance scale to ensure that our prior mass decreases evenly as we move father away from the base model.</p></li>
<li><p>User-defined scaling: We need the user to specify a quantity of interest <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Cxi)"> and a scale <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U">. We choose the scaling of the prior so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(Q(%5Cxi)%20%3E%20U)%20=%20%5Calpha">. This ensures that when we move to a new context, we are able to modify the prior by using the relevant information about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Cxi)">.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These four principles define a PC prior. I think the value of laying them out explicitly is that users and critics can clearly and cleanly identify if these principles are relevant to their problem and, if they are, they can implement them. Furthermore, if you need to modify the principles (say by choosing a different distance measure), there is a clear way to do that.</p>
<p>I’ve come to the end of my energy for this blog post, so I’m going to try to wrap it up. I will write more on the topic later, but for now there are a couple of things I want to say.</p>
<p>These priors can seem quite complex, but I assure you that are a) useful, b) used, and c) not too terrible in practice. Why? Well fundamentally because you usually don’t have to derive them yourselves. Moreover, a lot of that complexity is the price we pay for dealing with densities. We think that this is worth it and the lesson that the parameterisation that you are given may not be the correct parameterisation to use when specifying your prior is an important one!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-1/Penalising-Model-Component-Complexity--A-Principled-Practical-Approach-to/10.1214/16-STS576.full">original paper</a> contains a bunch of other examples. The paper was discussed and we wrote a <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-1/You-Just-Keep-on-Pushing-My-Love-over-the-Borderline/10.1214/17-STS576REJ.full">rejoinder</a><sup>40</sup>, which contains an out-of-date list of other PC priors people have derived. If you are interested in some other people’s views of this idea, a good place to start is <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-1">the discussion of the original paper</a>.</p>
<p>There are also PC priors for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00256">Gaussian Processes</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01180">disease mapping models</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08941">AR(p) processes</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00242">variance parameters in multilevel models</a>, and many more applications.</p>
<p>PC priors are all over the <a href="https://r-inla.org">INLA</a> software package and its documentation contains a bunch more examples.</p>
<p>Try them out. They’ll make you happy.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>I am told my Mercury is in Libra and truly I am not living that with those posts. Maybe Mercury was in Gatorade when I wrote them. So if we can’t be balanced at least let’s like things.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Our weapons of ass destruction that lives in Canada?↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Negative binomial parameterised by mean and overdispersion so that its mean is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and the variance is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu(1+%5Calpha%20%5Cmu)"> because we are not flipping fucking coins here↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Hello and welcome to Statistics for Stupid Children. My name is Daniel and I will be your host today.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>If we didn’t have stupid children we’d never get dumb adults and then who would fuck me? You? You don’t have that sort of time. You’ve got a mortgage to service and interest rates are going up. You’ve got your Warhammer collection and it is simply not going to paint itself. You’ve been meaning to learn how to cook Thai food. You simply do not have the time. (I’m on SSRIs so it’s never clear what will come first: the inevitable decay and death of you and your children and your children’s children; the interest, eventual disinterest, and inevitable death of the family archivist from the far future who digs up your name from the digital graveyard; the death of the final person who will ever think of you, thereby removing you from the mortal realm entirely; the death of the universe; or me. Fucking me is a real time commitment.)↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Gamma is parameterised by shape and rate, so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i"> has mean 1 and variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha">.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>integrate↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Sometimes, people still refer to these as <em>hyperparameters</em> and put priors on them, which would clarify things, but like everything in statistics there’s no real agreed upon usage. Because why would anyone want that?↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>somehow↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>location parameter↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>This is critical: we <em>do not know</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> so the only way we can put a sensible prior on the scaling parameter is if we disentangle the role of these two parameters!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>In fact, if my model estimated the data-level variance to be nearly zero I would assume I’ve fucked something up elsewhere and my model is either over-fitting or I have a redundancy in my model (like if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?J%20=%20n">).↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>There are some mathematical peculiarities that we will run into later when the base model is singular. But they’re not too bad.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>The Arianist heresy is that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three separate beings rather than consubstantial. It’s the reason for that bit of the Nicene. The statistical version most commonly occurs when you consider you model for your data conditional on the parameters (you likelihood) and your model for the parameters (your prior) as separate objects. This can lead to really dumb priors and bad inferences.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Complaining that a prior is adding information is like someone complaining to you that his boyfriend has stopped fucking him and you subsequently discovering that this is because his boyfriend died a few weeks ago. Like I’m sorry Jonathan, I know even the sight of a traffic cone sets your bussy a-quiverin’, but there really are bigger concerns and I’m gonna need you to focus.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>In this story, the bigger concerns are things like misspecification, incorrect assumptions, data problems etc etc, the traffic cone is an unbiased estimator, Jonathan is our stand in for a generic data analyst, and Jonathan’s bussy is said data scientist’s bussy.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>Yes, I know that there are problems with giving my generic data analyst a male name. Did I carefully think through the gender and power dynamics in my bussy simile? I think the answer to that is obvious.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>We use priors for the same reason that other people use penalties: we don’t want to go into a weird corner of our model space <em>unless</em> our data explicitly drags us there↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>This is a bit technical. When a model is over-parameterised, it’s not always possible to recover all of the parameters. So we ideally want to make sure that if there are bunch of asymptotically equivalent parameters, our prior operates sensibly on that set. An example of this will come in a future post where I’ll talk about priors for the parameters of a Gaussian process.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>That Arianism thing creeping in again!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>There are examples of theoretically motivated priors where it’s wildly expensive to compute their densities. We will see one in a later post about GPs.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>Sure, Jan.&nbsp;Of course we want that. But we believed that it was important to include this in a list of desiderata because we <em>never</em> want to say “our prior has motivation X and therefore it is good”. It is not enough to be pure, you actually have to work.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>What do I mean by near? Read on McDuff.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>Think of it as a P-spline if you must. The the important thing is that the weights of the basis functions are jointly normal with mean zero and precision matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20Q">.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>Given the knots, which are fixed↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>I might talk about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09712">more advanced solutions</a> at some point.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn31"><p>When performing the battered sav, it’s important to not speed up too quickly lest you over-batter.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>It also might not. I don’t care to work it out.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>The “easy” way to get this is to use the fact that the Gamma is in the exponential family and use the general formula for KL divergences in exponential families. The easier way is to look it up on Wikipedia↩︎</p></li>

  <title>Tail stabilization of importance sampling etimators: A bit of theory</title>

<p>Imagine you have a target probability distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta)"> and you want to estimate the expectation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_h%20=%20%5Cint%20h(%5Ctheta)%20p(%5Ctheta)%5C,d(%5Ctheta)">. That’s lovely and everything, but if it was easy none of us would have jobs. High-dimensional quadrature is a pain in the arse.</p>
<p>A very simple way to get an decent estimate of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_h"> is to use <em>importance sampling</em>, that is taking draws <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta_s">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s%20=%201,%5Cldots,%20S"> from some proposal distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta_s%20%5Csim%20g(%5Ctheta)">. Then, noting that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI_h%20=%20%5Cint%20h(%5Ctheta)%20p%20(%5Ctheta)%5C,d%5Ctheta%20=%20%5Cint%20h(%5Ctheta)%20%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Cfrac%7Bp(%5Ctheta)%7D%7Bg(%5Ctheta)%7D%7D_%7Br(%5Ctheta)%7Dg(%5Ctheta)%5C,d%5Ctheta,%0A"> we can use Monte Carlo to estimate the second integral. This leads to the importance sampling estimator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI_h%5ES%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bs=1%7D%5ES%20h(%5Ctheta_s)%20r(%5Ctheta_s).%0A"></p>
<p>This all seems marvellous, but there is a problem. Even though <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> is probably a very pleasant function and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g"> is a nice friendly distribution, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r(%5Ctheta)"> can be an absolute beast. Why? Well it’s<sup>1</sup> the ratio of two densities and there is no guarantee that the ratio of two nice functions is itself a nice function. In particular, if the bulk of the distributions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g"> are in different places, you’ll end up with the situation where for most draws <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r(%5Ctheta_s)"> is very small<sup>2</sup> and a few will be HUGE<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>This will lead to an extremely unstable estimator.</p>
<p>It is pretty well known that the raw importance sampler <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_h%5ES"> will behave nicely (that is will be unbiased with finite variance) precisely when the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_s%20=%20r(%5Ctheta_s)"> has finite variance.</p>
<p>Elementary treatments stop there, but they miss two very big problems. The most obvious one is that it’s basically impossible to check if the variance of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_s"> is finite. A second, much larger but much more subtle problem, is that the variance can be finite but <em>massive</em>. This is probably the most common case in high dimensions. McKay has an excellent example where the importance ratios are <em>bounded</em>, but that bound is so large that it is infinite for all intents and purposes.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that importance sampling doesn’t work unless you work on it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="truncated-importance-sampling">Truncated importance sampling</h2>
<p>If the problem is the fucking ratios then by gum we will fix the fucking ratios. Or so the saying goes.</p>
<p>The trick turns out to be modifying the largest ratios enough that we stabilise the variance, but not so much as to overly bias the estimate.</p>
<p>The first version of this was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27594308?seq=1">truncated importance sampling</a> (TIS), which selects a threshold <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> and estimates the expectation as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BS%7D%5Csum_%7Bs=%201%7D%5ES%20h(%5Ctheta_s)%20%5Cmax%5C%7Br(%5Ctheta_s),%20T%5C%7D.%0A"> It’s pretty obvious that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I%5ES_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D"> has finite variance for any fixed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T">, but we should be pretty worried about the bias. Unsurprisingly, there is going to be a trade-off between the variance and the bias. So let’s explore that.</p>
<section id="the-bias-of-tis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bias-of-tis">The bias of TIS</h3>
<p>To get an expression for the bias, first let us write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_s%20=%20r(%5Ctheta_s)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_s%20=%20h(%5Ctheta_s)"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta_s%20%5Csim%20g">. Occasionally we will talk about the joint distribution or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(r_s,h_s)%20%5Csim%20(R,H)">. Sometimes we will also need to use the indicator variables <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z_i%20=%201_%7Br_i%20%3C%20T%7D">.</p>
<p>Then, we can write<sup>4</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%20%5Cleq%20T)%20%5CPr(R%20%5Cleq%20T)%20+%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3E%20T)%20%5CPr(R%20%3E%20T).%0A"></p>
<p>How does this related to TIS? Well. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bs=1%7D%5ES%20z_i"> be the random variable denoting the number of times <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_i%20%3E%20T">. Then, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(I_%5Ctext%7BTIC%7D%5ES)%20&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BS%7D%5Csum_%7Bs=1%7D%5ESz_ih_ir_i%5Cright)%20%20+%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(%20%5Cfrac%7BT%7D%7BS%7D%5Csum_%7Bs=1%7D%5ES(1-z_i)h_i%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_M%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7BS-M%7D%7BS%7D%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3C%20T)%20+%20%5Cfrac%7BMT%7D%7BS%7D%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3E%20T)%5Cright%5D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%20%5Cleq%20T)%20%5CPr(R%20%5Cleq%20T)%20+%20T%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3E%20T)%20%5CPr(R%20%3E%20T).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>Hence the bias in TIS is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI%20-%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H(R-T)%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3E%20T)%20%5CPr(R%20%3E%20T).%0A"></p>
<p>To be honest, this doesn’t look phenomenally interesting for fixed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T">, however if we let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T%20=%20T_S"> depend on the sample size then as long as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_S%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty"> we get vanishing bias.</p>
<p>We can get more specific if we make the assumption about the tail of the importance ratios. In particular, we will assume that<sup>5</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-R(r)%20=%20%5CPr(R%20%3E%20r)%20=%20cr%5E%7B-1/k%7D(1+o(1))"> for some<sup>6</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%3C1">.</p>
<p>While it seems like this will only be useful for estimating <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(R%3ET)">, it turns out that under some mild<sup>7</sup> technical conditions, the conditional excess distribution function<sup>8</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AR_T(y)%20=%20%5CPr(R%20-%20T%20%5Cleq%20y%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3E%20T)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BR(T%20+%20y)%20-%20R(T)%7D%7B1-R(T)%7D,%0A"> is well approximated by a Generalised Pareto Distribution as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty">. Or, in maths, as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AR_T(y)%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%201-%20%5Cleft(1%20+%20%5Cfrac%7Bky%7D%7B%5Csigma%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B-1/k%7D,%20%5Cquad%20&amp;%20k%20%5Cneq%200%20%5C%5C%0A1-%20%5Cmathrm%7Be%7D%5E%7B-y/%5Csigma%7D,%20%5Cquad%20&amp;k%20=%200,%0A%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A"> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20%3E%200"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D">. The shape<sup>9</sup> parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> is very important for us, as it tells us how many moments the distribution has. In particular, if a distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> has shape parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%7CX%7C%5E%5Calpha%20%3C%20%5Cinfty,%20%5Cquad%20%5Cforall%20%5Calpha%20%3C%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D.%0A"> We will focus exclusively on the case where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20%3C%201">. When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20%3C%201/2">, the distribution has finite variance.</p>
<p>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-%20R(r)%20=%20cr%5E%7B-1/k%7D(1+%20o(1))">, then the conditional exceedence function is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0AR_T(y)%20&amp;=%20%20%5Cfrac%7BcT%5E%7B-1/k%7D(1+%20%20o(1))%20-%20c(T+y)%5E%7B-1/k%7D(1+%20%20o(1))%7D%7BcT%5E%7B-1/k%7D(1+%20%20o(1)))%7D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cleft%5B1%20-%20%5Cleft(1%20+%20%5Cfrac%7By%7D%7BT%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B-1/k%7D%5Cright%5D(1%20+%20o(1)),%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> which suggests that as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_T"> converges to a generalised Pareto distribution with shape parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> and scale parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(T)">.</p>
<p>All of this work lets us approximate the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(R-T%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET%20)"> and use the formula for the mean of a generalised Pareto distribution.

<section id="the-variance-in-tis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-variance-in-tis">The variance in TIS</h3>
<p>The variance is a little bit more annoying. We want it to go to zero.</p>
<p>As before, we condition on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z_s"> (or, equivalently, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M">) and then use the law of total variance. We know from the bias calculation that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES%20%5Cmid%20M)%20=%5Cfrac%7BS-M%7D%7BS%7D%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%20+%20%5Cfrac%7BTM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET).%0A"></p>
<p>A similarly quick calculation tells us that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES%20%5Cmid%20M)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BS-M%7D%7BS%5E2%7D%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%20%5Cleq%20T)%20+%5Cfrac%7BMT%5E2%7D%7BS%5E2%7D%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET).%0A"> To close it out, we recall that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> is the sum of Bernoulli random variables so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AM%20%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BBinomial%7D(S,%20%5CPr(R%20%3E%20T)).%0A"></p>
<p>With this, we can get an expression for the unconditional variance. To simplify the expression, let’s write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_T%20=%20%5CPr(R%20%3E%20T)">. Then, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES)%20&amp;=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_M%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES%20%5Cmid%20M)%20+%20%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D_M%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES%20%5Cmid%20M)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20S%5E%7B-1%7D(1-p_T)%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%20%5Cleq%20T)%20+S%5E%7B-1%7DT%5E2p_T%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%5C%5C%0A&amp;%5Cquad%20+%20S%5E%7B-1%7Dp_T(1-p_T)%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%5E2%20+%20S%5E%7B-1%7DTp_T(1-p_T)%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%5E2.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>There are four terms in the variance. The first and third terms are clearly harmless: they go to zero no matter how we choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_S">. Our problem terms are the second and fourth. We can tame the fourth term if we choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_S%20=%20o(S)">. But that doesn’t seem to help with the second term. But it turns out it is enough. To see this, we note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0ATp_T%5Cmathbb%7BV%7D(H%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%20&amp;=%5Cleq%20Tp_T%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%5E2%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%5C%5C%0A&amp;%5Cleq%20p_T%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%5E2%20R%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%5Cleq%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%5E2%20R)%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cint%20h(%5Ctheta)%5E2%20p(%5Ctheta)%5C,d%5Ctheta%20%3C%20%5Cinfty.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> where the second inequality uses the fact that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%3ET"> and the third comes from the law of total probability.</p>
<p>So the TIS estimator has vanishing bias and variance as long as the truncation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_S%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_S%20=%20o(S)">. Once again, this is in the TIS paper, where it is proved in a much more compact way.</p>

<section id="asymptotic-properties" class="level3">

<p>It can also be useful to have an understanding of how wild the fluctuations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I%20-%20I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES"> are. For traditional importance sampling, we know that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(R%5E2)"> is finite, then then the fluctuations are, asymptotically, normally distributed with mean zero. Non-asymptotic results were given by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01437">Chatterjee and Diaconis</a> that also hold even when the estimator has infinite variance.</p>
<p>For TIS, it’s pretty obvious that for fixed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%20%5Cgeq%200">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_%5Ctext%7BTIS%7D%5ES"> will be asymptotically normal (it is, after all, the sum of bounded random variables). For growing sequences <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_S"> it’s a tiny bit more involved: it is now a triangular array<sup>11</sup> rather than a sequence of random variables. But in the end very classical results tell us that for bounded<sup>12</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">, the fluctuations of the TIS estimator are asymptotically normal.</p>
<p>It’s worth saying that when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h(%5Ctheta)"> is unbounded, it <em>might</em> be necessary to truncate the product <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_ir_i"> rather than just <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_i">. This is especially relevant if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R=r)"> grows rapidly with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">. Personally, I can’t think of a case where this happens: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r(%5Ctheta)"> usually grows (super-)exponentially in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h(%5Ctheta)"> usually grows polynomially, which implies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R=r)"> grows (poly-)logarithmically.</p>
<p>The other important edge case is that when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h(%5Ctheta)"> can be both positive and negative, it might be necessary to truncate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_ir_i"> both above <em>and</em> below.</p>

<p>TIS has lovely theoretical properties, but it’s a bit challenging to use in practice. The problem is, there’s really no practical guidance on how to choose the truncation sequence.</p>
<p>So let’s do this differently. What if instead of specifying a threshold directly, we instead decided that the largest <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> values are potentially problematic and should be modified? Recall that for TIS, the number of samples that exceeded the threshold, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M">, was random while the threshold was fixed. This is the opposite situation: the number of exceedences is fixed but the threshold is random.</p>
<p>The threshold is now the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M">th largest value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_s">. We denote this using order statistics notation: we re-order the sample so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar_%7B1:S%7D%20%5Cleq%20r_%7B2:S%7D%5Cleq%20%5Cldots%20r_%7BS:S%7D.%0A"> With this notation, the threshold is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T%20=%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D"> and the Winsorized importance sampler (WIS) is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI%5ES_%5Ctext%7BWIS%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BS%7D%5Csum_%7Bs%20=%201%7D%5E%7BS-M%7D%20h_%7Bs:S%7Dr_%7Bs:S%7D%20+%20%5Cfrac%7Br_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%7D%7BS%7D%5Csum_%7Bs=S-M+1%7D%5ES%20h_%7Bs:S%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(r_%7Bs:S%7D,%20h_%7Bs:S%7D)"> are the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(r_s,%20h_s)"> pairs <em>ordered</em> so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7B1:S%7D%20%5Cleq%20r_%7B2:S%7D%5Cleq%20%5Ccdots%20%5Cleq%20r_%7BS:S%7D">. Note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_%7Bs:S%7D"> are not necessarily in increasing order: they are known as <em>concomitants</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7Bs:S%7D">, which is just a fancy way to say that they’re along for the ride. It’s <em>very</em> important that we reorder the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_s"> when we reorder the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_s">, otherwise we won’t preserve the joint distribution and we’ll end up with absolute rubbish.</p>
<p>We can already see that this is both much nicer and much wilder than the TIS distribution. It is <em>convenient</em> that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> is no longer random! But what the hell are we going to do about those order statistics? Well, the answer is very much the same thing as before: condition on them and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Conditioned on the event<sup>13</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Br_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%20=%20T%5C%7D">, we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(I_%5Ctext%7BWIS%7D%5ES%20%5Cmid%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%20=%20T%5Cright)%20=%20%5Cleft(1%20-%20%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cright)%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(RH%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3C%20T)%20+%20%5Cfrac%7BMT%7D%7BS%7D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%20%5Cgeq%20T).%0A"> From this, we get that the bias, conditional on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%20=%20T"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Bmultline*%7D%0A%5Cleft%7CI%20-%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(I_%5Ctext%7BWIS%7D%5ES%20%5Cmid%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%20=%20T%5Cright)%5Cright%7C%20=%5Cleft%7C%5Cleft%5B%5CPr(R%20%3C%20T)%20-%20%5Cleft(1%20-%20%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cright)%5Cright%5D%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(RH%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3C%20T)%20%5Cright.%5C%5C%0A%5Cleft.+%20%5Cleft%5B%5CPr(R%20%5Cgeq%20T)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cright%5D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H(R%20-%20T)%20%5Cmid%20R%20%5Cgeq%20T)%5Cright%7C.%0A%5Cend%7Bmultline*%7D"></p>
<p>You should immediately notice that we are in quite a different situation from TIS, where only the tail contributed to the bias. By fixing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> and randomising the threshold, we have bias contributions from both the bulk (due, essentially, to a weighting error) and from the tail (due to both the weighting error and the truncation). This is going to require us to be a bit creative.</p>
<p>We could probably do something more subtle and clever here, but that is not my way. Instead, let’s use the triangle inequality to say <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cleft%7C%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(RH%20%5Cmid%20R%20%3E%20T)%5Cright%7C%20%5Cleq%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(R%20%7CH%7C%201(R%3CT))%7D%7B%5CPr(R%20%3CT)%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Cfrac%7B%5C%7Ch%5C%7C_%7BL%5E1(p)%7D%7D%7B%5CPr(R%20%20%3CT)%7D%0A"> and so the first term in the bias can be bounded if we can bound the relative error <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%7C1%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1-%20M/S%7D%7B%5CPr(R%20%3C%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D)%7D%5Cright%7C.%0A"></p>
<p>Now the more sensible among you will say <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-HryG35A2E">Daniel, No!</a> That’s a ratio! That’s going to be hard to bound</em>. And, of course, you are right. But here’s the thing: if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> is small relative to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">, it is <em>tremendously</em> unlikely that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D"> is anywhere near zero. This is intuitively true, but also mathematically true.</p>
<p>To attack this expectation, we are going to look at a slightly different quantity that has the good grace of being non-negative.</p>

<p>You could, quite reasonably, ask where the hell that incomplete Beta function came from. And if I had thought to look this up, I would say that it came from Equation 2.1.5 in David and Nagaraja’s book on order statistics. Unfortunately, I did not look this up. I derived it, which is honestly not very difficult. The trick is to basically note that the event <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Bx_%7Bk:S%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Ctau%5C%7D"> is the same as the event that at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> of the samples <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_s"> are less than or equal to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Because the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_s"> are independent, this is the probability of observing at least <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> heads from a coin with the probability of a head <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(x%20%5Cleq%20%5Ctau)%20=%20F_X(%5Ctau)">. If you look this up on Wikipedia<sup>14</sup> you see<sup>15</sup> that it is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_%7B1-F_X(%5Ctau)%7D(k,S-k+1)">. The rest just come from noting that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%20=%20F_X%5E%7B-1%7D(t/(p+t))"> and using the symmetry <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-I_p(a,b)%20=%20I_%7B1-p%7D(b,a)">.</p>
<p>To finish this off, we note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%20%5Cleq%20x)%20=%20I_%7B%5Cfrac%7BS-k+1%7D%7B(S-k+1)x+%20k%7D%7D(S-k+1,k).%0A"> From which, we see that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5CPr%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7BF_X(x_%7Bk:S%7D)%7D%20-%20p%20%5Cleq%20t%5Cright)%20&amp;=%5CPr%5Cleft(%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bp(S-k+1)%7Dt%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5CPr%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bp(S-k+1)%7D%7Bk%7D%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%20%5Cleq%20t%5Cright).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>The second result follows the same way and by noting that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> is also F-distributed with parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(k,%20S-k+1)">.</p>
<p><em>The proof has ended</em></p>
</div>
<p>Now, obviously, in this house we do not trust mathematics. Which is to say that I made a stupid mistake the first time I did this and forgot that when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> is binomial, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(Z%20%5Cgeq%20k)%20=%201%20-%20%5CPr(Z%20%5Cleq%20k-1)"> and had a persistent off-by-one error in my derivation. But we test out our results so we don’t end up doing the dumb thing.</p>
<p>So let’s do that. For this example, we will use generalised Pareto-distributed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting here that we’ve also calculated that the bias is <em>at most</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(M/S)">, however, this rate is extremely sloppy.

<p>But do not fear: we can recover. At the cost of an assumption about the tails of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R">. (We’re also going to assume that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> is bounded because it makes things ever so slightly easier, although unbounded <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> is ok<sup>18</sup> as long as it doesn’t grow too quickly relative to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">.)</p>
<p>We are going to make the assumption that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%20-%20T%20%5Cmid%20R%5Cgeq%20T"> is in the domain of attraction of a generalized Pareto distribution with shape parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k">. A sufficient condition, due to von Mises, is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clim_%7Br%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Br%20R'(r)%7D%7B1-R(r)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>This seems like a weird condition, but it’s basically just a regularity condition at infinity. For example if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-R(r)"> is regularly varying at infinity<sup>19</sup> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R'(r)"> is, eventually, monotone<sup>20</sup> decreasing, then this condition holds.</p>
<p>The von Mises condition is very natural for us as <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-probability/volume-21/issue-3/Von-Mises-Conditions-Revisited/10.1214/aop/1176989120.full">Falk and Marohn (1993)</a> show that the relative error we get when approximating the tail of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R"> by a generalised Pareto density is the same as the relative error in the von Mises condition. That is if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7BrR'(r)%7D%7B1-R(r)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D(1%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(r%5E%7B-%5Calpha%7D))%0A"> then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AR'(r)%20=%20c%20w(cr%20-%20d)(1%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(r%5E%7B-%5Calpha%7D)),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c,d"> are constants and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> is the density of a generalised Pareto distribution.</p>
<p>Anyway, under those two assumptions, we can swap out the density of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(R-T)%5Cmid%20R%3ET"> with its asymptotic approximation and get that, conditional on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T=%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H(R-T)%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%20=%20(k-1)%5E%7B-1%7DT.%0A"></p>
<p>Hence, the second term in the bias goes to zero if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5Cleft(1%20-%20R(r_%7Bs-M+1:S%7D)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cright)%5Cright)%0A"> goes to zero.</p>
<p>Now this is not particularly pleasant, but it helps to recognise that even if a distribution doesn’t have finite moments, away from the extremes, its order statistics always do. This means that we can use Cauchy-Schwartz to get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cleft%7C%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5Cleft(1%20-%20R(r_%7Bs-M+1:S%7D)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cright)%5Cright)%5Cright%7C%20%5Cleq%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5E2%5Cright)%5E%7B1/2%7D%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cleft(1%20-%20R(r_%7Bs-M+1:S%7D)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cright)%5E2%5Cright%5D%5E%7B1/2%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>Arguably, the most alarming term is the first one, but that can<sup>21</sup> be tamed.

<p>Right, that was a bit of a journey, but let’s keep going to the variance.</p>
<p>It turns out that following the route I thought I was going to follow does not end well. That lovely set of tricks breaking up the variance into two conditional terms turns out to be very very unnecessary. Which is good, because I thoroughly failed to make the argument work.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, the problem is that the random variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7BMr_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%7D%7BS%7D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R%20%5Cgeq%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BMr_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%7D%7BS(1-R(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D))%7D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%201_%7BR%20%5Cgeq%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%7D)%0A"> is an absolute <em>bastard</em> to bound. The problem is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1-%20R(%7Br_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%7D)%20%5Capprox%20M/S"> and so the usual trick of bounding that truncated expectation by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Ch%5C%7C"> or some such thing will prove that the variance is <em>finite</em> but not that it goes to zero. There is a solid chance that the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7BMr_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5E%7B1/2%7D%7D%7BS(1-R(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D))%7D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5E%7B1/2%7DH%201_%7BR%20%5Cgeq%20r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%7D)%20%5Cleq%5Cfrac%7BMr_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5E%7B1/2%7D%7D%7BS(1-R(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D))%7DR(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D)%5C%7Ch%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2(p)%7D%0A"> would work. But truly that is just bloody messy<sup>31</sup>.</p>
<p>So let’s do it the easy way, shall we.

<p>This goes to zero as long as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D)%20=%20o(S%5E2)">.</p>
<p><a href="https://projecteuclid.org/proceedings/berkeley-symposium-on-mathematical-statistics-and-probability/Proceedings-of-the-Fifth-Berkeley-Symposium-on-Mathematical-Statistics-and/Chapter/Some-contributions-to-the-theory-of-order-statistics/bsmsp/1200513012">Bickel (1967)</a> shows that, noting that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(R)%20%3C%20%5Cinfty">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D)%20%5Cleq%20C%20(S-M+1)%5Cfrac%7B%5CGamma(S+1)%5CGamma(S-M+1-1)%5CGamma(M)%7D%7B%5CGamma(S-M+1+1)%5CGamma(M+1)%5CGamma(S-1)%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BS%7D%7BM%7D(1%20+%20o(1)),%0A"> and so the variance is bounded.</p>
<p>The previous argument shows that the variance is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(M%5E%7B-1%7DS%5E%7B-1%7D)">. We can refine that if we assume the von Mises condition hold. In that case we know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R(r)%20=%201-%20cr%5E%7B-1/k%7D%20+%20o(1)"> as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty"> and therefore <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0AR%5Cleft(R%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft(1-%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS%7D%5Cright)%5Cright)%20&amp;=%201-%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS+1%7D%5C%5C%0A1%20-%20cR%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft(1-%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS+1%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B-1/k%7D(1+o(1))%20&amp;=%201-%20%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS+1%7D%20%5C%5C%0AR%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft(1-%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS+1%7D%5Cright)%20&amp;=%20c%5E%7B-k%7D%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BM%7D%7BS+1%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B-k%7D(1%20+%20o(1)).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> Bickel (1967) shows that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(r_%7Bk:S%7D)%20=%20R%5E%7B-1%7D(1-M/(S+1))%20+%20o(1)"> so combining this with the previous result gives a variance of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D((M/S)%5E%7Bk-2%7D)">. If we take <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M%20=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(S%5E%7B1/2%7D)">, this gives <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%5E%7Bk/2-1%7D">, which is smaller than the previous bound for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%3C1">. It’s worth noting that Hence the variance goes to zero.</p>
<p>The argument that we used here is a modification of the argument in the TIS paper. This lead to a great deal of panic: did I just make my life extremely difficult? Could I have modified the TIS proof to show the bias goes to zero? To be honest, someone might be able to, but I can’t.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pareto-smoothed-importance-sampling">Pareto-smoothed importance sampling</h2>
<p>Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (or PSIS) takes the observation that the tails are approximately Pareto distributed to add some bias correction to the mix. Essentially, it works by noting that approximating <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(1-R(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D))%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%3Er_%7BS-M+1:S%7D)%20%5Capprox%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BS%7D%5Csum_%7Bm=1%7D%5EM%20w_m%20h_%7BS-M+m:S%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_m"> is the median<sup>32</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">th order statistic in an iid sample of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> Generalised Pareto random variables with tail parameters fitted to the distribution.</p>
<p>This is a … funky … quadrature rule. To see that, we can write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(HR%20%5Cmid%20R%3ET)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(R%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(H%20%5Cmid%20R)).%0A"> If we approximate the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%20%3E%20T"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctilde%7BR%7D_%5Ctext%7BPSIS%7D(r)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%7D%5Csum_%7Bm=1%7D%5EM%201(%20w_m%3Cr)%0A"> and approximate the conditional probability by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(H%20%3C%20h%5Cmid%20R%20=%20w_m)%20%5Capprox%201(h_%7BS-M+m:S%7D%3C%20h).%0A"></p>
<p>Empirically, this is a very good choice (with the mild caveat that you need to truncate the largest expected order statistic by the observed maximum in order to avoid some variability issues). I would love to have a good analysis of why that is so, but honest I do not.</p>
<p>But, to the issue of this blog post the convergence and vanishing variance still holds. To see this, we note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aw_m%20=%20r_%7BS-M+1%7D%20%20+%20k%5E%7B-1%7D%5Csigma%5Cleft%5B%5Cleft(1-%5Cfrac%7Bj-1/2%7D%7BM%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B-k%7D%20-1%5Cright%5D.%0A"> So we are just re-weighting our tail <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> samples by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A1%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csigma%7D%7Bkr_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cleft(1-%5Cfrac%7Bj-1/2%7D%7BM%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B-k%7D%20-1%5Cright%5D.%0A"></p>
<p>Recalling that when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R(r)%20=%201-%20cr%5E%7B-1/k%7D(1+%20o(1))">, we had <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20=%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(r_%7BS-M+1:S%7D)">, this term is at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(1%20+%20M%5E%7B-k%7D)">. This will not trouble either of our convergence proofs.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>So that’s what truncation and winsorization does to importance sampling estimates. I haven’t touched on the fairly important topic of asymptotic normality. Essentially, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304414988900312">Griffin (1988)</a>, in a fairly complex<sup>36</sup> paper that suggests that if you winsorize the product <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(h(%5Ctheta_s)r(%5Ctheta_s))"> <em>and</em> winsorize it at both ends, the von Mises condition<sup>37</sup> imply that the WIS estimator is asymptotically normal.</p>
<p>Why is this important, well the same proof shows that doubly winsorized importance sampling (dWIS) applied to the vector valued function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20h(%5Ctheta)%20=%20(h(%5Ctheta),1)"> will also be asymptotically normal, which implies, via the delta method, that the <em>self normalized</em> dWIS estimator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI%5ES_%5Ctext%7BSN-IS%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bs=1%7D%5ES%5Cmax%5C%7B%5Cmin%5C%7Bh(%5Ctheta_i)%20r(%5Ctheta_i),T_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5C%7D,%20T_%7BM:S%7D%5C%7D%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bs=1%7D%5ES%5Cmax%5C%7B%5Cmin%5C%7Br(%5Ctheta_i),T_%7BS-M+1:S%7D%5C%7D,T_%7BM:S%7D%5C%7D%7D%0A"> is consistent, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_%7Bm:S%7D"> is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">th order statistic of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmax%5C%7Bh(%5Ctheta_s)r(%5Ctheta_s),%20r(%5Ctheta_s)%5C%7D">.</p>
<p>It is very very likely that this can be shown (perhaps under some assumptions) for something closer to the version of PSIS we use in practice. But that is an open question.</p>

<li id="fn16"><p>Ok. I checked. And yeah.

  <title>Sparse matrices 6: To catch a derivative, first you’ve got to think like a derivative</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Welcome to part six!!! of our ongoing series on making sparse linear algebra differentiable in JAX with the eventual hope to be able to do some <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-22-a-linear-mixed-effects-model/">cool statistical shit</a>. We are <em>nowhere near done</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-05-14-sparse4-some-primatives/">Last time</a>, we looked at making JAX primitives. We built four of them. Today we are going to implement the corresponding differentiation rules! For three<sup>1</sup> of them.</p>
<p>So strap yourselves in. This is gonna be detailed.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the code<sup>2</sup>, the git repo for this post is linked at the bottom and in there you will find a folder with the python code in a python file.</p>
<section id="she-is-beauty-and-she-is-grace.-she-is-queen-of-50-states.-she-is-elegance-and-taste.-she-is-miss-autodiff" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="she-is-beauty-and-she-is-grace.-she-is-queen-of-50-states.-she-is-elegance-and-taste.-she-is-miss-autodiff">She is beauty and she is grace. She is queen of 50 states. She is elegance and taste. She is miss autodiff</h2>
<p>Derivatives are computed in JAX through the glory and power of automatic differentiation. If you came to this blog hoping for a great description of how autodiff works, I am terribly sorry but I absolutely do not have time for that. Might I suggest google? Or maybe flick through <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05031">this survey by Charles Margossian.</a>.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember about algorithmic differentiation is that it is <em>not</em> symbolic differentiation. That is, it does not create the functional form of the derivative of the function and compute that. Instead, it is a system for cleverly composing derivatives in each bit of the program to compute the <em>value</em> of the derivative of the function.</p>
<p>But for that to work, we need to implement those clever little mini-derivatives. In particular, every function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(%5Ccdot):%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em"> needs to have a function to compute the corresponding Jacobian-vector product <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(%5Ctheta,%20v)%20%5Crightarrow%20J(%5Ctheta)%20v,%0A"> where the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Ctimes%20m"> matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?J(%5Ctheta)"> has entries <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AJ(%5Ctheta)_%7Bij%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20f_j%20%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Ctheta_j%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>Ok. So let’s get onto this. We are going to derive and implement some Jacobian-vector products. And all of the assorted accoutrement. And by crikey. We are going to do it all in a JAX-traceable way.</p>
</section>
<section id="jvp-number-one-the-linear-solve." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jvp-number-one-the-linear-solve.">JVP number one: The linear solve.</h2>
<p>The first of the derivatives that we need to work out is the derivative of a linear solve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7Db">. Now, intrepid readers, the obvious thing to do is look the damn derivative up. You get exactly no hero points for computing it yourself.</p>
<p>But I’m not you, I’m a dickhead.</p>
<p>So I’m going to derive it. I could pretend there are reasons<sup>3</sup>, but that would just be lying. I’m doing it because I can.</p>
<p>Beyond the obvious fun of working out a matrix derivative from first principles, this is fun because we have <em>two</em> arguments instead of just one. Double the fun.</p>
<p>And we really should make sure the function is differentiated with respect to every reasonable argument. Why? Because if you write code other people might use, you don’t get to control how they use it (or what they will email you about). So it’s always good practice to limit surprises (like a function not being differentiable wrt some argument) to cases<sup>4</sup> where it absolutely necessary. This reduces the emails.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s take an arbitrary SPD matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> with a <em>fixed</em> sparsity pattern. Let’s take another symmetric matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta"> with <em>the same sparsity pattern</em> and assume that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta"> is small enough<sup>5</sup> that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20+%20%5CDelta"> is still symmetric positive definite. We also need a vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta"> with a small <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7C%5Cdelta%5C%7C">.</p>
<p>Now let’s get algebraing. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Af(A%20+%20%5CDelta,%20b%20+%20%5Cdelta)%20&amp;=%20(A+%5CDelta)%5E%7B-1%7D(b%20+%20%5Cdelta)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20(I%20+%20A%5E%7B-1%7D%5CDelta)%5E%7B-1%7DA%5E%7B-1%7D(b%20+%20%5Cdelta)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20(I%20-%20A%5E%7B-1%7D%5CDelta%20+%20o(%5C%7C%5CDelta%5C%7C))A%5E%7B-1%7D(b%20+%20%5Cdelta)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db%20+%20A%5E%7B-1%7D(%5Cdelta%20-%20%5CDelta%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db%20)%20+%20o(%5C%7C%5CDelta%5C%7C%20+%20%5C%7C%5Cdelta%5C%7C)%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>Easy<sup>6</sup> as.</p>
<p>We’ve actually calculated the derivative now, but it’s a little more work to recognise it.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to remember the practical definition of the Jacobian of a function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x)"> that takes an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-dimensional input and produces an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">-dimensional output. It is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Ctimes%20m"> matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?J_f(x)"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Af(x%20+%20%5Cdelta)%20%20=%20f(x)%20+%20J_f(x)%5Cdelta%20+%20o(%5C%7C%5Cdelta%5C%7C).%0A"></p>
<p>The formulas further simplify if we write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db">. Then, if we want the Jacobian-vector product for the first argument, it is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A-A%5E%7B-1%7D%5CDelta%20c,%0A"> while the Jacobian-vector product for the second argument is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AA%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cdelta.%0A"></p>
<p>The only wrinkle in doing this is we need to remember that we are only storing the lower triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">. Because we need to represent <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta"> the same way, it is represented as a vector <code>Delta_x</code> that contains only the lower triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta">. So we need to make sure we remember to form the <em>whole</em> matrix before we do the matrix-vector product <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta%20c">!</p>
<p>But otherwise, the implementation is going to be pretty straightforward. The Jacobian-vector product costs one additional linear solve (beyond the one needed to compute the value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db">).</p>
<p>In the language of JAX (and autodiff in general), we refer to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta"> as <em>tangent vectors</em>. In search of a moderately coherent naming convention, we are going to refer to the tangent associated with the variable <code>x</code> as <code>xt</code>.</p>
<p>So let’s implement this. Remember: it needs<sup>7</sup> to be JAX traceable.</p>

<p>For some sense of continuity, we are going to keep the naming of the primitives from the last blog post, but we are <em>not</em> going to attack them in the same order. Why not? Because we work in order of complexity.</p>
<p>So first off we are going to do the triangular solve. As I have yet to package up the code (I promise, that will happen next<sup>8</sup>), I’m just putting it here under the fold.</p>

<p>Before we see if this works, let’s first have talk about the structure of the function I just wrote. Generally speaking, we want a function that takes in the primals and tangents at tuples and then returns the value and the<sup>9</sup> Jacobian-vector product.</p>
<p>The main thing you will notice in the code is that there is <em>a lot</em> of checking for <code>ad.Zero</code>. This is a special type defined in JAX that is, essentially, telling the autodiff system that we are not differentiating wrt that variable. This is different to a tangent that just happens to be numerically equal to zero. Any code for a Jacobian-vector product needs to handle this special value.</p>
<p>As we have two arguments, we have 3 interesting options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Both <code>L_xt</code> and <code>bt</code> are <code>ad.Zero</code>: This means the function is a constant and the derivative is zero. I am fairly certain that we do not need to manually handle this case, but because I don’t know and I do not like surprises, it’s in there.</p></li>
<li><p><code>L_xt</code> is <em>not</em> <code>ad.Zero</code>: This means that we need to differentiate wrt the matrix. In this case we need to compute <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta%20c"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta%5ET%20c">, depending on the <code>transpose</code> argument. In order to do this, I used the <code>jax.experimental.sparse.CSC</code> class, which has some very limited sparse matrix support (basically matrix-vector products). This is <em>extremely</em> convenient because it means I don’t need to write the matrix-vector product myself!</p></li>
<li><p><code>bt</code> is <em>not</em> <code>ad.Zero</code>: This means that we need to differentiate wrt the rhs vector. This part of the formula is pretty straightforward: just an application of the primal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the case that either <code>L_xt</code> or <code>bt</code> are <code>ad.Zero</code>, we simply set the corresponding contribution to the jvp to zero.</p>
<p>It’s worth saying that you can bypass all of this <code>ad.Zero</code> logic by writing separate functions for the JVP contribution from each input and then chaining them together using<sup>10</sup> <code>ad.defjvp2()</code> to <a href="https://github.com/google/jax/blob/41417d70c03b6089c93a42325111a0d8348c2fa3/jax/_src/lax/linalg.py#L791">chain them together</a>. This is what the <code>lax.linalg.triangular_solve()</code> implementation does.</p>
<p>So why didn’t I do this? I avoided this because in the other primitives I have to implement, there are expensive computations (like Cholesky factorisations) that I want to share between the primal and the various tangent calculations. The <code>ad.defjvp</code> frameworks don’t allow for that. So I decided not to demonstrate/learn two separate patterns.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transposition">Transposition</h3>
<p>Now I’ve never actively wanted a Jacobian-vector product in my whole life. I’m sorry. I want a gradient. Gimme a gradient. I am the Veruca Salt of gradients.</p>
<p>In may autodiff systems, if you want<sup>11</sup> a gradient, you need to implement vector-Jacobian products<sup>12</sup> explicitly.</p>
<p>One of the odder little innovations in JAX is that instead of forcing you to implement this as well<sup>13</sup>, you only need to implement half of it.</p>
<p>You see, some clever analysis that, as far as I far as I can tell<sup>14</sup>, is detailed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10923">this paper</a> shows that you only need to form explicit vector-Jacobian products for the structurally linear arguments of the function.</p>
<p>In JAX (and maybe elsewhere), this is known as a <em>transposition rule</em>. The combination of a transopition rule and a JAX-traceable Jacobian-vector product is enough for JAX to compute all of the directional derivatives and gradients we could ever hope for.</p>
<p>As far as I understand, it is all about functions that are <em>structurally linear</em> in some arguments. For instance, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A(x)"> is a matrix-valued function and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> are vectors, then the function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Af(x,%20y)%20=%20A(x)y%20+%20g(x)%0A"> is structurally linear in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> in the sense that for every fixed value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">, the function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Af_x(y)%20=%20A(x)%20y%20+%20g(x)%0A"> is linear in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">. The resulting transpositon rule is then</p>

<p>The first element of the return is <code>None</code> because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x,y)"> is not<sup>15</sup> structurally linear in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> so there is nothing to transpose. The second element simply takes the matrix in the linear function and transposes it.</p>
<p>If you know anything about autodiff, you’ll think “this doesn’t <em>feel</em> like enough” and it’s not. JAX deals with the non-linear part of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x,y)"> by tracing the evaluation tree for its Jacobian-vector product and … manipulating<sup>16</sup> it.</p>
<p>We already built the abstract evaluation function last time around, so the tracing part can be done. All we need is the transposition rule.</p>
<p>The linear solve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(A,%20b)%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db"> is non-linear in the first argument but linear in the second argument. So we only need to implement <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AJ%5ET_b(A,b)w%20=%20A%5E%7B-T%7Dw,%0A"> where the subscript <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> indicates we’re only computing the Jacobian wrt <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">.</p>
<p>Initially, I struggled to work out what needed to be implemented here. The thing that clarified the process for me was looking at JAX’s <a href="https://github.com/google/jax/blob/41417d70c03b6089c93a42325111a0d8348c2fa3/jax/_src/lax/linalg.py#L747">internal implementation</a> of the Jacobian-vector product for a dense matrix. From there, I understood what this had to look like for a vector-valued function and this is the result.</p>

<p>If this doesn’t make a lot of sense to you, that’s because it’s confusing.</p>
<p>One way to think of it is in terms of the more ordinary notation. Mike Giles has <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/NA-08-01.pdf">a classic paper</a> that covers these results for basic linear algebra. The idea is to imagine that, as part of your larger program, you need to compute <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db">.</p>
<p>Forward-mode autodiff computes the <em>sensitivity</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">, usually denoted <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdot%20c"> from the sensitivies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdot%20A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdot%20b">. These have already been computed. The formula in Giles is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cdot%20c%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7D(%5Cdot%20b%20-%20%5Cdot%20A%20c).%0A"> The canny reader will recognise this as exactly<sup>17</sup> the formula for the Jacobian-vector product.</p>
<p>So what does reverse-mode autodiff do? Well it moves through the program in the other direction. So instead of starting with the sensitivities <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdot%20A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdot%20b"> already computed, we instead start with the<sup>18</sup> <em>adjoint sensitivity</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%20c">. Our aim is to compute <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%20A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%20b"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%20c">.</p>
<p>The details of how to do this are<sup>19</sup> <em>beyond the scope</em>, but without tooooooo much effort you can show that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbar%20b%20=%20A%5E%7B-T%7D%20%5Cbar%20c,%0A"> which you should recognise as the equation that was just implemented.</p>
<p>The thing that we <em>do not</em> have to implement in JAX is the other adjoint that, for dense matrices<sup>20</sup>, is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbar%7BA%7D%20=%20-%5Cbar%7Bb%7Dc%5ET.%0A"> Through the healing power of … something?—Truly I do not know.— JAX can work that bit out itself. woo.</p>

<p>So let’s see if this works. I’m not going to lie, I’m flying by the seat of my pants here. I’m not super familiar with the JAX internals, so I have written a lot of test cases. You may wish to skip this part. But rest assured that almost every single one of these cases was useful to me working out how this thing actually worked!</p>

<p>This is the same test case as the last blog. We will just use the lower triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> as the test matrix.</p>
<p>First things first, let’s check out the numerical implementation of the function. We will do that by comparing the implemented Jacobian-vector product with the <em>definition</em> of the Jacobian-vector product (aka the forward<sup>21</sup> difference approximation).</p>
<p>There are lots of things that we could do here to turn these into <em>actual</em> tests. For instance, the test suite inside JAX has a lot of nice convenience functions for checking implementations of derivatives. But I went with homespun because that was how I was feeling.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice that I’m using random numbers here, which is fine for a blog. Not so fine for a test that you don’t want to be potentially<sup>22</sup> flaky.</p>
<p>The choice of <code>eps = 1e-4</code> is roughly<sup>23</sup> because it’s the square root of the single precision machine epsilon<sup>24</sup>. A very rough back of the envelope calculation for the forward difference approximation to the derivative shows that the square root of the machine epislon is about the size you want your perturbation to be.</p>

<p>Making the numerical implementation work is only half the battle. We also have to make it work <em>in the context of JAX</em>.</p>
<p>Now I would be lying if I pretended this process went smoothly. But the first time is for experience. It’s mostly a matter of just reading the documentation carefully and going through similar examples that have already been implemented.</p>
<p>And testing. I learnt how this was supposed to work by testing it.</p>
<p>(For full disclosure, I also wrote a big block f-string in the <code>sparse_triangular_solve()</code> function at one point that told me the types, shapes, and what <code>transpose</code> was, which was how I worked out that my code was breaking because I forgot the first to <code>None</code> outputs in the transposition rule. When it doubt, print shit.)</p>
<p>As you will see from my testing code, I was not going for elegance. I was running the damn permutations. If you’re looking for elegance, look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Ok. So this is a very similar problem to the one that we just solved. But, as fate would have it, the solution is going to look quite different. Why? Because we need to compute a Cholesky factorisation.</p>
<p>First things first, though, we are going to need a JAX-traceable way to compute a Cholesky factor. This means that we need<sup>25</sup> to tell our <code>sparse_solve</code> function the how many non-zeros the sparse Cholesky will have. Why? Well. It has to do with how the function is used.</p>
<p>When <code>sparse_cholesky()</code> is called with concrete inputs<sup>26</sup>, then it can quite happily work out the sparsity structure of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">. But when JAX is preparing to transform the code, eg when it’s building a gradient, it calls <code>sparse_cholesky()</code> using abstract arguments that only share the shape information from the inputs. This is <em>not</em> enough to compute the sparsity structure. We <em>need</em> the <code>indices</code> and <code>indptr</code> arrays.</p>
<p>This means that we need <code>sparse_cholesky()</code> to throw an error if <code>L_nse</code> isn’t passed. This wasn’t implemented well last time, so here it is done properly.</p>
<p>(If you’re wondering about that <code>None</code> argument, it is the identity transform. So if <code>A_indices</code> is a concrete value, <code>ind = A_indices</code>. Otherwise an error is called.)</p>

<p>That’s all well and good. Nothing weird there.</p>
<p>The problem comes when you need to implement the transposition rule. Remembering that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%20b%20=%20A%5E%7B-T%7D%5Cbar%20c%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cbar%20c">, you might see the issue: we are going to need the Cholesky factorisation. <em>But we have no way to pass</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> <em>to the transpose function</em>.</p>
<p>This means that we would need to compute <em>two</em> Cholesky factorisations per gradient instead of one. As the Cholesky factorisation is our slowest operation, we do not want to do extra ones! We want to compute the Cholesky triangle once and pass it around like a party bottom<sup>27</sup>. We do not want each of our functions to have to make a deep and meaningful connection with the damn matrix<sup>28</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-different-solution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-different-solution">A different solution</h3>
<p>So how do we pass around our Cholesky triangle? Well, I do love a good class so my first thought was “fuck it. I’ll make a class and I’ll pass it that way”. But the developers of JAX had a <em>much</em> better idea.</p>
<p>Their idea was to abstract the idea of a linear solve and its gradients. They do this through <code>lax.custom_linear_solve</code>. This is a function that takes all of the bits that you would need to compute <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7Db"> and all of its derivatives. In particular it takes<sup>29</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>matvec</code>: A function that <code>matvec(x)</code> that computes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Ax">. This might seem a bit weird, but it’s the most common atrocity committed by mathematicians is abstracting<sup>30</sup> a matrix to a linear mapping. So we might as well just suck it up.</li>
<li><code>b</code>: The right hand side vector<sup>31</sup></li>
<li><code>solve</code>: A function that takes takes the <code>matvec</code> and a vector so that<sup>32</sup> <code>solve(matvec, matvec(x)) == x</code></li>
<li><code>symmetric</code>: A boolean indicating if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is symmetric.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea (happily copped from the implementation of <code>jax.scipy.linalg.solve</code>) is to wrap our Cholesky decomposition in the solve function. Through the never ending miracle of partial evaluation.</p>

<p>There are three things of note in that implementation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The calls to <code>lax.stop_gradient()</code>: These tell JAX to not bother computing the gradient of these terms. The relevant parts of the derivatives are computed explicitly by <code>lax.custom_linear_solve</code> in terms of <code>matmult</code> and <code>solve</code>, neither of which need the explicit derivative of the cholesky factorisation.!</p></li>
<li><p>That definition of <code>matmult()</code><sup>33</sup>: Look. I don’t know what to tell you. Neither addition nor indexing is implemented for <code>jsparse.CSC</code> objects. So we did it the semi-manual way. (I am thankful that matrix-vector multiplication is available)</p></li>
<li><p>The definition of <code>solver()</code>: Partial evaluation is a wonderful wonderful thing. <code>functools.partial()</code> transforms <code>lax.custom_linear_solve()</code> from a function that takes 3 arguments (and some keywords), into a function <code>solver()</code> that takes one<sup>34</sup> argument<sup>35</sup> (<code>b</code>, the only positional argument of <code>lax.custom_linear_solve()</code> that isn’t specified).</p></li>

<p>The other option for making this work would’ve been to implement the Cholesky factorisation as a primitive (~which we are about to do!~ which we will do another day) and then write the sparse solver directly as a pure JAX function.</p>

<p>This function is JAX-traceable<sup>36</sup> and, therefore, we could compute the gradient of it directly. It turns out that this is going to be a bad idea.</p>
<p>Why? Because the derivative of <code>sparse_cholesky</code>, which we would have to chain together with the derivatives from the solver, is pretty complicated. Basically, this means that we’d have to do a lot more work<sup>37</sup> than we do if we just implement the symbolic formula for the derivatives.</p>

<p>Ok, so now we get to the good one. The log-determinant of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">. The first thing that we need to do is wrench out a derivative. This is not as easy as it was for the linear solve. So what follows is a modification for sparse matrices from Appendix A of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">Boyd’s convex optimisation book</a>.</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to convince yourself that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Clog(%7CA%20+%20%5CDelta%7C)%20&amp;=%20%5Clog%5Cleft(%20%5Cleft%7CA%5E%7B1/2%7D(I%20+%20A%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5CDelta%20A%5E%7B-1/2%7D)A%5E%7B1/2%7D%5Cright%7C%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Clog(%7CA%7C)%20+%20%5Clog%5Cleft(%20%5Cleft%7CI%20+%20A%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5CDelta%20A%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5Cright%7C%5Cright).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>It is harder to convince yourself how this could possibly be a useful fact.</p>
<p>If we write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda_i">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20=%201,%20%5Cldots,%20n"> as the eigenvalues of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5CDelta%20A%5E%7B-1/2%7D">, then we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clog(%7CA%20+%20%5CDelta%20%7C)%20=%20%5Clog(%7CA%7C)%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5En%20%5Clog(%201%20+%20%5Clambda_i).%0A"> Remembering that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta"> is very small, it follows that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5CDelta%20A%5E%7B-1/2%7D"> will <em>also</em> be small. That translates to the eigenvalues of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1/2%7D%5CDelta%20A%5E%7B-1/2%7D"> all being small. Therefore, we can use the approximation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog(1%20+%20%5Clambda_i)%20=%20%5Clambda_i%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(%5Clambda_i%5E2)">.</p>
<p>This means that<sup>38</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Clog(%7CA%20+%20%5CDelta%20%7C)%20&amp;=%20%5Clog(%7CA%7C)%20+%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5En%20%20%5Clambda_i%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5Cleft(%5C%7C%5CDelta%5C%7C%5E2%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%5Clog(%7CA%7C)%20+%20%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D%5Cleft(A%5E%7B-1/2%7D%20%5CDelta%20A%5E%7B-1%7D%20%5Cright)%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5Cleft(%5C%7C%5CDelta%5C%7C%5E2%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Clog(%7CA%7C)%20+%20%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D%5Cleft(A%5E%7B-1%7D%20%5CDelta%20%5Cright)%20+%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5Cleft(%5C%7C%5CDelta%5C%7C%5E2%5Cright),%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> which follows from the cyclic property of the trace.</p>
<p>If we recall the formula from the last section defining the Jacobian-vector product, in our context <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20=%201">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> is the vector of non-zero entries of the lower triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> stacked by column, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta"> is the vector of non-zero entries of the lower triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta">. That means the Jacobian-vector product is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AJ(x)%5Cdelta%20=%20%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D%5Cleft(A%5E%7B-1%7D%20%5CDelta%20%5Cright)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5En%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5En%5BA%5E%7B-1%7D%5D_%7Bij%7D%20%5CDelta_%7Bij%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>Remembering that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta"> is sparse with the same sparsity pattern as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, we see that the Jacobian-vector product requires us to know the values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7D"> that correspond to non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">. That’s good news because we will see that these entries are relatively cheap and easy to compute. Whereas the full inverse is dense and very expensive to compute.</p>
<p>But before we get to that, I need to point out a trap for young players<sup>39</sup>. Lest your implementations go down faster than me when someone asks politely.</p>
<p>The problem comes from how we store our matrix. A mathematician would suggest that it’s our representation. A physicist<sup>40</sup> would shit on about being coordinate free with such passion that he<sup>41</sup> will keep going even after you quietly leave the room.</p>
<p>The problem is that we only store the non-zero entries of the lower-triangular part of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">. This means that <em>we need to be careful</em> that when we compute the Jacobian-vector product that we properly compute the Matrix-vector product.</p>
<p>Let <code>A_indices</code> and <code>A_indptr</code> define the sparsity structure of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> (and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta">). Then if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_x"> is our input and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> is our vector, then we need to do the follow steps to compute the Jacobian-vector product:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compute <code>Ainv_x</code> (aka the non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7D"> that correspond to the sparsity pattern of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">)</li>

<p>Why does it look like that? Well we need to add the contribution from the upper triangle as well as the lower triangle. And one way to do that is to just double the sum and then subtract off the diagonal terms that we’ve counted twice.</p>
<p>(I’m making a pretty big assumption here, which is fine in our context, that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> has a non-zero diagonal. If that doesn’t hold, it’s just a change of the indexing in the second term to just pull out the diagonal terms.)</p>
<p>Using similar reasoning, we can compute the Jacobian as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5BJ_f(x)%5D_%7Bi1%7D%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A%5Coperatorname%7Bpartial-inverse%7D(x)_i,%20%5Cqquad%20&amp;%20x_i%20%20%5Ctext%7B%20is%20a%20diagonal%20element%20of%20%7DA%20%5C%5C%0A2%5Coperatorname%7Bpartial-inverse%7D(x)_i,%20%5Cqquad%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D,%0A%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7Bpartial-inverse%7D(x)"> is the vector that stacks the columns of the elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7D"> that correspond to the non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">.

<section id="computing-the-partial-inverse" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computing-the-partial-inverse">Computing the partial inverse</h3>
<p>So now we need to actually work out how to compute this <em>partial inverse</em> of a symmetric positive definite matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">. To do this, we are going to steal a technique that goes back to Takahashi, Fagan, and Chen<sup>42</sup> in 1973. (For this presentation, I’m basically pillaging <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378375807000845">Håvard Rue and Sara Martino’s 2007 paper.</a>)</p>
<p>Their idea was that if we write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%20VDV%5ET">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> is a lower-triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D"> is diagonal. This links up with our usual Cholesky factorisation through the identity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%20=%20VD%5E%7B1/2%7D">. It follows that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7D">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?VDV%5ETS%20=%20I">.

<p>Once again, this does not look super-useful. The trick is to notice 2 things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> is lower triangular, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V%5E%7B-1%7D"> is also lower triangular and the elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V%5E%7B-1%7D"> are the inverse of the diagonal elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> (aka they are all 1). Therefore, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5E%7B-1%7DV%5E%7B-1%7D"> is a lower triangular matrix with a diagonal given by the diagonal of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?D%5E%7B-1%7D">.</p></li>
<li><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I%20-%20V%5ET"> is an upper triangular matrix and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5BI%20-%20V%5ET%5D_%7Bnn%7D%20=%200">.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These two things together lead to the somewhat unexpected situation where the upper triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%20=%20D%5E%7B-1%7DV%5E%7B-1%7D%20+%20(I-%20V%5ET)S"> defines a set of recursions for the upper triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">. (And, therefore, all of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> is symmetric!) These are sometimes referred to as the Takahashi recursions.</p>
<p>But we don’t want the whole upper triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">, we just want the ones that correspond to the non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">. Unfortunately, the set of recursions are not, in general, solveable using only that subset of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">. But we are in luck: they are solveable using the elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> that correspond to the non-zeros of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%20+%20L%5ET">, which, as we know from a few posts ago, is a superset of the non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">!</p>
<p>From this, we get the recursions running from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20=%20n,%20%5Cldots,%201">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j%20=%20n,%20%5Cldots,%20i"> (the order is important!) such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bji%7D%20%5Cneq%200"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AS_%7Bji%7D%20=%20%20%20%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BL_%7Bii%7D%5E2%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BL_%7Bii%7D%7D%5Csum_%7Bk=i+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20L_%7Bki%7D%20S_%7Bkj%7D%20%5Cqquad&amp;%20%20%5Ctext%7Bif%20%7D%20i=j,%20%5C%5C%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BL_%7Bii%7D%7D%5Csum_%7Bk=i+1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20L_%7Bki%7D%20S_%7Bkj%7D%20%20&amp;%20%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D.%0A%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A"></p>
<p>If you recall our discussion way back when about the way the non-zero structure of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> the column of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> relates to the non-zero structure of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> th column for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j%20%5Cgeq%20i">, it’s clear that we have computed enough<sup>44</sup> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> at every step to complete the recursions.</p>
<p>Now we just need to Python it. (And thanks to Finn Lindgren who helped me understand how to implement this, which he may or may not remember because it happened about five years ago.)</p>
<p>Actually, we need this to be JAX-traceable, so we are going to implement a very basic primitive. In particular, we don’t need to implement a derivative or anything like that, just an abstract evaluation and an implementation.</p>

<p>The implementation makes use of the<sup>45</sup> <em>dictionary of keys</em> representation of a sparse matrix from <code>scipy.sparse</code>. This is an efficient storage scheme when you need to modify the sparsity structure (as we are doing here) or do a lot of indexing. It would definitely be possible to implement this directly on the CSC data structure, but it gets a little bit tricky to access the elements of <code>L_inv</code> that are above the diagonal. The resulting code is honestly a mess and there’s lots of non-local memory access anyway, so I implemented it this way.</p>
<p>But let’s be honest: this thing is crying out for a proper symmetric matrix class with sensible reverse iterators. But hey. Python.</p>
<p>The second chunk of the code is just the opposite of our <code>_structured_copy()</code> function. It takes a matrix with the sparsity pattern of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> and returns one with the sparsity pattern of <code>out</code> (which is assumed to be a subset, and is usually the sparsity pattern of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> or a diagonal matrix).</p>
<p>Let’s check that it works.</p>

<p>All of our bits are in place, so now all we need is to implement the primitive for the log-determinant. One nice thing here is that we don’t need to implement a transposition rule as the function is not structurally linear in any of its arguments. At this point we take our small wins where we can get them.</p>
<p>There isn’t anything particularly interesting in the implementation. But do note that the trace has been implemented in a way that’s aware that we’re only storing the bottom triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">.</p>

<p>I’m not going to lie, I am <em>not happy</em> with that JVP difference. I was somewhat concerned that there was a bug somewhere in my code. I did a little bit of exploring and the error got larger as the problem got larger. It also depended a little bit more than I was comfortable on how I had implemented<sup>46</sup> the baseline dense version.</p>
<p>That second fact suggested to me that it might be a floating point problem. By default, JAX uses single precision (32-bit) floating point. Most modern systems that don’t try and run on GPUs use double precision (64-bit) floating point. So I tried it with double precision and lo and behold, the problem disappears.</p>
<p>Matrix factorisations are bloody hard in single precision.</p>

<p>And that is where we will leave it for today. Next up, I’m probably going to need to do the autodiff for the Cholesky factorisation. It’s not <em>hard</em>, but it is tedious<sup>47</sup> and this post is already very long.</p>
<p>After that we need a few more things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Compilation rules for all of these things. For the most part, we can just wrap the relevant parts of <a href="https://github.com/libigl/eigen">Eigen</a>. The only non-trivial code would be the partial inverse. That will allow us to JIT shit.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to beef up the sparse matrix class a little. In particular, we are going to need addition and scalar multiplication at the very minimum to make this useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Work out how <a href="https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Aesara</a> works so we can try to prototype a PyMC model.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That will be <em>a lot</em> more blog posts. But I’m having fun. So why the hell not.</p>

<li id="fn4"><p>To the best of my knowledge, for example, we don’t know how to differentiate with respect to the order parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> in the modified Bessel function of the second kind <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K_%5Cnu(x)">. This is important in spatial statistics (and general GP stuff).↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p><em>You</em> may need to convince yourself that this is possible. But it is. The cone of SPD matrices is very nice.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Don’t despair if you don’t recognise the third line, it’s the Neumann series, which gives an approximation to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(I%20+%20B)%5E%7B-1%7D"> whenever <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7CB%5C%7C%20%5Cll%201">.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>I recognise that I’ve not explained why everything needs to be JAX-traceable. Basically it’s because JAX does clever transformations to the Jacobian-vector product code to produce things like gradients. And the only way that can happen is if the JVP code can take abstract JAX types. So we need to make it traceable because we <em>really</em> want to have gradients!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Why not now, Daniel? Why not now? Well mostly because I might need to do some tweaking down the line, so I am not messing around until I am done.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>This is the primary difference between implementing forward mode and reverse mode: there is only one output here. When we move onto reverse mode, we will output a tuple Jacobian-transpose-vector products, one for each input. You can see the structure of that reflected in the transposition rule we are going to write later.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Some things: Firstly your function needs to have the correct signature for this to work. Secondly, you could also use <code>ad.defjvp()</code> if you didn’t need to use the primal value to define the tangent (recall one of our tangents is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7D%5CDelta%20c">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20=%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db"> is the primal value).↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This is because it is the efficient way of computing a gradient. Forward-mode autodiff chains together Jacobian-vector products in such a way that a single sweep of the entire function computes a single directional derivative. Reverse-mode autodiff chains together Jacobian-transpose-vector products (aka vector-Jacobian products) in such a way that a single sweep produces an entire gradient. (This happens at the cost of quite a bit of storage.) Depending on what you are trying to do, you usually want one or the other (or sometimes a clever combination of both).↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>or gradients or some sort of thing.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>to be honest, in Stan we sometimes just don’t dick around with the forward-mode autodiff, because gradients are our bread and butter.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>I mean, love you programming language people. But fuck me this paper could’ve been written in Babylonic cuneiform for all I understood it.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>That is, if you fix a value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_y(x)%20=%20f(x,%20y)"> is not an affine function.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Details bore me.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>In general, there might need to be a little bit of reshaping, but it’s equivalent.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Have you noticed this is like the third name I’ve used for this equivalent concept. Or the fourth? The code calls it a cotangent because that’s another damn synonym. I’m so very sorry.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>not difficult, I’m just lazy and Mike does it better that I can. Read his paper.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>For sparse matrices it’s just the non-zero mask of that.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>Yes. I know. Central differences. I am what I am.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>Some of the stuff I’ve done like normalising all of the inputs would help make these tests more stable. You should also just pick up Nick Higham’s backwards error analysis book to get some ideas of what your guarantees actually are in floating point, but I truly cannot be bothered. This is scratch code.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>It should be slightly bigger, it isn’t.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>The largest number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon"> such that <code>float(1.0) == float(1.0 + machine_eps)</code> in single precision floating point.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>Fun fact: I implemented this and the error never spawned, so I guess JAX is keeping the index arrays concrete, which is very nice of it!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>actual damn numbers↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>We want that <a href="https://youtu.be/wrnUJoj14ag?t=288">auld triangle to go jingle bloody jangle</a>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>We definitely do not want someone to write an eight hour, two part play that really seems to have the point of view that our Cholesky triangle deserved his downfall. Espoused while periodically reading deadshit tumblr posts. I mean, it would win a Tony. But we still do not want that.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>There are more arguments. Read the help. This is what we need↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>What if I told you that this would work perfectly well if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> was a linear partial differential operator or an integral operator? Probably not much because why would you give a shit?↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>It can be more general, but it isn’t↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>I think there is a typo in the docs↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>Full disclosure: I screwed this up multiple times today and my tests caught it. What does that look like? The derivatives for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> being off, but everything else being good.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>And some optional keyword arguments, but we don’t need to worry about those↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>This is not quite the same but similar to something that functional programming people call <em>currying</em>, which was named after famous Australian Olympic swimmer Lisa Curry.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>and a shitload simpler!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>And we have to store a bunch more. This is less of a big deal when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> is sparse, but for an ordinary linear solve, we’d be hauling around an extra <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(n%5E2)"> floats containing tangents for no good reason.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>If you are worrying about the suppressed constant, remember that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> (and therefore <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7CA%5C%7C">) is fixed.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>I think I’ve made this mistake about four times already while writing this blog. So I am going to write it <em>out</em>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>Not to “some of my best friends are physicists”, but I do love them. I just wished a man would talk about me the way they talk about being coordinate free. Rather than with the same ambivalence physicist use when speaking about a specific atlas. I’ve been listening to lesbian folk music all evening. I’m having feelings.↩︎</p></li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is part <em>five</em> of our <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-22-a-linear-mixed-effects-model/">ongoing</a> <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-23-getting-jax-to-love-sparse-matrices/">series</a> <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-05-14-jax-ing-a-sparse-cholesky-factorisation-part-3-in-an-ongoing-journey/">on</a> <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-05-16-design-is-my-passion-sparse-matrices-part-four/">implementing</a> differentiable sparse linear algebra in JAX. In some sense this is the last boring post before we get to the derivatives. Was this post going to include the derivatives? It sure was but then I realised that a different choice was to go to bed so I can get up nice and early in the morning and vote in our election.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that before I split the posts, it was more than twice as long and I was nowhere near finished. So probably the split was a good choice.</p>
<section id="but-how-do-you-add-a-primative-to-jax" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-how-do-you-add-a-primative-to-jax">But how do you add a primative to JAX?</h2>
<p>Well, the first step is you <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/How_JAX_primitives_work.html">read the docs.</a></p>
<p>They tell you that you need to implement a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>An implementation of the call with “abstract types”</li>
<li>An implementation of the call with concrete types (aka evaluation the damn function)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if you want your primitive to be JIT-able, you need to implement a compilation rule.</p></li>
<li><p>if you want your primitive to be batch-able, you need to implement a batching rule.</p></li>
<li><p>if you want your primitive to be differentiable, you need to implement the derivatives in a way that allows them to be propagated appropriately.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we are going to do the first task: we are going to register JAX-traceable versions of the four main primitives we are going to need for our task. For the most part, the implementations here will be replaced with C++ bindings (because only a fool writes their own linear algebra code). But this is the beginning<sup>1</sup> of our serious journey into JAX.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-things-first-some-primitives">First things first, some primitives</h2>
<p>In JAX-speak, a primitive is a function that is JAX-traceable<sup>2</sup>. It is not necessary for every possible transformation to be implemented. In fact, today I’m not going to implement <em>any</em> transformations. That is a problem for future Dan.</p>
<p>We have enough today problems.</p>
<p>Because today we need to write four new primitives.</p>
<p>But first of all, let’s build up a test matrix so we can at least check that this code runs. This is the same example from <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-05-14-jax-ing-a-sparse-cholesky-factorisation-part-3-in-an-ongoing-journey/">blog 3</a>. You can tell my PhD was in numerical analysis because I fucking love a 2D Laplacian.</p>

<p>Because I’m feeling lazy today and we don’t actually need the Cholesky directly for any of this, I’m going to just use scipy. Why? Well, honestly, just because I’m lazy. But also so I can prove an important point: the implementation of the primitive <em>does not</em> need to be JAX traceable. So I’m implementing it in a way that is not now and will likely never be JAX traceable<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>First off, we need to write the solve function and bind it<sup>4</sup> to JAX. Specific information about what exactly some of these commands are doing can be found <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/How_JAX_primitives_work.html#primal-evaluation-rules">in the docs</a>, but the key thing is that there is <em>no reason</em> to dick around whit JAX types in any of these implementation functions. They are only ever called using (essentially) numpy<sup>5</sup> arrays. So we can just program like normal human beings.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate its transformations, JAX will occasionally<sup>6</sup> call functions using <em>abstract</em> data types. These data types know the shape of the inputs and their data type. So our next step is to specialise the <code>sparse_solve</code> function for this case. We might as well do some shape checking while we’re just hanging around. But the essential part of this function is just saying that the output of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7Db"> is the same shape as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> (which is usually a vector, but the code is no more complex if it’s a [dense] matrix).</p>

<p>This is very similar. We need to have a function that computes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B-1%7Db"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B-T%7Db">. The extra wrinkle from the last time around is that we need to pass a keyword argument <code>transpose</code> to indicate which system should be solved.</p>
<p>Once again, we are going to use the appropriate <code>scipy</code> function (in this case <code>sparse.linalg.spsolve_triangular</code>). There’s a little bit of casting between sparse matrix types here as <code>sparse.linalg.spsolve_triangular</code> assumes the matrix is in CSR format.</p>

<p>Now we can check if it works. We can use the fact that our matrix <code>(A_indices, A_indptr, A_x)</code> is lower-triangular (because we only store the lower triangle) to make our test case.</p>

<section id="primitive-three-the-sparse-cholesky" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="primitive-three-the-sparse-cholesky">Primitive three: The sparse cholesky</h3>
<p>Ok. This one is gonna be a pain in the arse. But we need to do it. Why? Because we are going to need a JAX-traceable version further on down the track.</p>
<p>The issue here is that the non-zero pattern of the Cholesky decomposition is computed <em>on the fly</em>. This is absolutely not allowed in JAX. It <em>must</em> know the shape of all things at the moment it is called.</p>
<p>This is going to make for a somewhat shitty user experience for this function. It’s unavoidable with JAX designed<sup>7</sup> the way it is.</p>
<p>The code in <code>jax.experimental.sparse.bcoo.fromdense</code> has this exact problem. In their case, they are turning a dense matrix into a sparse matrix and they can’t know until they see the dense matrix how many non-zeros there are. So they do the sensible thing and ask the user to specify it. They do this using the <code>nse</code> keyword parameter. If you’re curious what <code>nse</code> stands for, it turns out it’s not “non-standard evaluation” but rather “number of specified entries”. Most other systems use the abbreviation <code>nnz</code> for “number of non-zeros”, but I’m going to stick with the JAX notation.</p>
<p>The one little thing we need to add to this code is a guard to make sure that if the <code>sparse_cholesky</code> function is called without specifying</p>

<p>So we are done for today. Our next step will be to implement all of the bits that are needed to make the derivatives work. So in the next instalment we will differentiate log-determinants, Cholesky decompositions, and all kinds of other fun things.</p>

  <title>Sparse Matrices 4: Design is my passion</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is the fourth post in a series where I try to squeeze autodiffable sparse matrices into JAX with the aim to speed up some model classes in PyMC. So far, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlined the problem <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-22-a-linear-mixed-effects-model/">Post 1</a></li>
<li>Worked through a basic python implementation of a sparse Cholesky decomposition <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-23-getting-jax-to-love-sparse-matrices/">Post 2</a></li>
<li>Failed to get JAX to transform some numpy code into efficient, JIT-compileable code <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-05-14-jax-ing-a-sparse-cholesky-factorisation-part-3-in-an-ongoing-journey/">Post 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am in the process of writing a blog on building new primitives<sup>1</sup> into JAX, but as I was doing it I accidentally wrote a long section about options for exposing sparse matrices. It really didn’t fit very well into that blog, so here it is.</p>
<section id="what-are-we-trying-to-do-here" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-we-trying-to-do-here">What are we trying to do here?</h2>
<p>If you recall from <a href="">the first blog</a>, we need to be able to compute the value and gradients of the (un-normalised) log-posterior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clog(p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y))%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Cmu_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%5ETA%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7Dy%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Clog(%7CQ(%5Ctheta)%7C)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog(%7CQ_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%7C)%20+%20%5Ctext%7Bconst%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ctheta)"> is a sparse matrix, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmu_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D%20Q_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%5E%7B-1%7D%20A%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7Dy.%0A"></p>
<p>Overall, our task is to design a system where this un-normalised log-posterior can be evaluated and differentiated efficiently. As with all design problems, there are a lot of different ways that we can implement it. They share a bunch of similarities, so we will actually end up implementing the guts of all of the systems.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s think of all of the ways we can implement our target<sup>2</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-1-the-direct-design" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-1-the-direct-design">Option 1: The direct design</h2>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Clog(%7CA%7C)">, for a sparse, symmetric positive definite matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(A,b)%20%5Crightarrow%20A%5E%7B-1%7Db">, for a sparse, symmetric positive definite matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and a vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"></li>
</ul>
<p>This option is, in some sense, the most straightforward. We implement primitives for both of the major components of our target and combine them using existing JAX primitives (like addition, scalar multiplication, and dot products).</p>
<p>This is a bad idea.</p>
<p>The problem is that both primitives require the Cholesky decomposition of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, so if we take this route we might end up computing an extra Cholesky decomposition. And you may ask yourself: <em>what’s an extra Cholesky decomposition between friends?</em></p>
<p>Well, Jonathan, it’s the most expensive operation we are doing for these models, so perhaps we should avoid the 1/3 increase in running time!</p>
<p>There are some ways around this. We might implement sparse, symmetric positive definite matrices as a class that, upon instantiation, computes the Cholesky factorisation.</p>

<p>In contexts where we need a Cholesky decomposition of every SPD matrix we instantiate, this design might be useful. It might also be useful to write a constructor that takes a <code>jax.experimental.CSCMatrix</code>, so that we could build a differentiable matrix and then just absolutely <em>slam</em> it into our filthy little Cholesky context<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In order to use this type of pattern with JAX, we would need to register it as a Pytree class, which involves writing flatten and unflatten routines. The <a href="https://github.com/google/jax/blob/712ab66f2855acf8a3f3c3977f80edb4447e7644/jax/experimental/sparse/csr.py">CSCSparse class</a> is a good example of how to implement this type of thing. Some care would be needed to make sure the differentiation rules don’t try to do something stupid like differentiate with respect to <code>self.iperm</code> or <code>self.L_x</code>. This is beyond the extra <a href="https://github.com/google/jax/blob/712ab66f2855acf8a3f3c3977f80edb4447e7644/jax/experimental/sparse/ad.py">autodiff sugar</a> in the experimental sparse library.</p>
<p>Implementing this would be quite an undertaking, but it’s certainly an option. The most obvious downside of this pattern (plus a fully functional sparse matrix class) is that it may end up being quite delicate to have this volume of auxillary information<sup>4</sup> in a pytree while making everything differentiate properly. This doesn’t seem to be how most parts of JAX has been built. There are also a couple of <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html#custom-pytrees-and-initialization">sharp corners</a> we could run into with instantiation.</p>
<p>To close this out, it’s worth noting a variation on this pattern that comes up: the optional Cholesky. The idea is that rather than compute the permutations and the Cholesky factorisation on initialisation, we store a boolean flag in the class <code>is_cholesky</code> and, whenever we need a Cholesky factor we check <code>is_cholesky</code> and if it’s <code>True</code> we use the computed Cholesky factor and otherwise we compute it and set <code>is_cholesky = True</code>.</p>
<p>This pattern introduces state to the object: it is no longer <em>set and forget</em>. This will not work within JAX<sup>5</sup>, where objects need to be immutable. It’s also not an exceptional pattern in general: it is considerably easier to debug code with stateless objects.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-2-implement-all-of-the-combinations-of-functions-that-we-need">Option 2: Implement all of the combinations of functions that we need</h2>
<p>Rather than dicking around with classes, we could just implement primitives that compute</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Clog(%7CA%7C)">, for a sparse, symmetric positive definite matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"></li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(A,b,%20c)%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Clog(%7CA%7C)%20+%20c%5ETA%5E%7B-1%7Db">, for a sparse, symmetric positive definite matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and vectors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is exactly what we need to do our task and nothing more. It won’t result in any unnecessary Cholesky factors. It doesn’t need us to store computed Cholesky factors. We can simply eat, prey, love.</p>
<p>The obvious downside to this option is it’s going to just massively expand the codebase if there are more things that we want to do. It’s also not obvious why we would do this instead of just making <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog%20p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)"> a primitive<sup>6</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-3-just-compute-the-cholesky" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-3-just-compute-the-cholesky">Option 3: Just compute the Cholesky</h2>
<p>Our third option is to simply compute (and differentiate) the Cholesky factor directly. We can then compute <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog(%7CA%7C)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7Db"> through a combination of differentiable operations on the elements of the Cholesky factor (for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog(%7CA%7C)">) and triangular linear solves <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B-1%7Db"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B-T%7Dc"> (for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5E%7B-1%7Db">).</p>
<p>Hence we require the following two<sup>7</sup> JAX primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Coperatorname%7Bchol%7D(A)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7Bchol%7D(A)"> is the Cholesky factor of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(L,%20b)%20%5Crightarrow%20L%5E%7B-1%7D%20b"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(L,%20b)%20%5Crightarrow%20L%5E%7B-T%7Db"> for lower-triangular sparse matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is pretty close to how the dense version of this function would be implemented.</p>
<p>There are two little challenges with this pattern:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We are adding another large-ish node <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> to our autodiff tree. As we saw in other patterns, this is unnecessary storage for our problem at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of non-zeros in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> is a function of the non-zero pattern of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">. This means the Cholesky will need to be implemented very carefully to ensure that its traceable enough.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The second point here might actually be an issue. To be honest, I have no idea. I think maybe it’s fine? But I need to do a close read on <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/How_JAX_primitives_work.html#reverse-differentiation">the adding primitives doc</a>. Essentially, as long as the abstract traces just need shapes but not dimensions, we should be ok.</p>
<p>For adding this to something like Stan, however, we will likely need to do some extra work to make sure we know the number of parameters.</p>
<p>The advantage of this type of design pattern is that it gives users the flexibility to do whatever perverted thing they want to do with the Cholesky triangle. For example, they might want to do a centring/non-centring transformation. In Option 1, we would need to write explicit functions to let them do that (not difficult, but there’s a lot of code to write, which has the annoying tendency to increases the maintainence burden).</p>
</section>
<section id="option-4-functors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-4-functors">Option 4: Functors!</h2>
<p>A slightly wilder design pattern would be to abandon sparse matrices and just make functions <code>A(theta, ...)</code> that return a sparse matrix. If that function is differentiable wrt its first argument, then we can build this whole thing up that way.</p>
<p>In reality, the only way I can think of to implement this pattern would be to implement a whole differentiable sparse matrix arithmetic (make operations like <code>alpha * A + beta * B</code>, <code>C * D</code> work for sparse matrices). At which point, we’ve basically just recreated option 1.</p>
<p>I’m really only bringing up functors because unlike sparse matrices, it is actually a pretty good model for implementing Gaussian Processes with general covariance functions. There’s a little bit of the idea in <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/math/issues/1011">this Stan issue</a> that, to my knowledge, hasn’t gone anywhere. More recently, a variant has been used successfully in the (as yet un-merged) <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/math/tree/try-laplace_student/stan/math/laplace">Laplace approximation feature</a> in Stan.</p>
</section>
<section id="which-one-should-we-use" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-one-should-we-use">Which one should we use?</h2>
<p>We don’t really need to make that choice yet. So we won’t.</p>
<p>But personally, I like option 1. I expect everyone else on earth would prefer option 3. For densities that see a lot of action, it would make quite a bit of sense to consider making that density a primitive when it has a complex derivative (<em>à la</em> option 2).</p>
<p>But for now, let’s park this and start getting in on the implementations.</p>

  <title>Sparse Matrices 3: Failing at JAX</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is part three of an ongoing exercise in hubris. <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-22-a-linear-mixed-effects-model/">Part one is here.</a> <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-23-getting-jax-to-love-sparse-matrices/">Part two is here.</a> The overall aim of this series of posts is to look at how sparse Cholesky factorisations work, how JAX works, and how to marry the two with the ultimate aim of putting a bit of sparse matrix support into PyMC, which should allow for faster inference in linear mixed models, Gaussian spatial models. And hopefully, if anyone ever gets around to putting the Laplace approximation in, all sorts of GLMMs and non-Gaussian models with splines and spatial effects.</p>
<p>It’s been a couple of weeks since the last blog, but I’m going to just assume that you are fully on top of all of those details. To that end, let’s jump in.</p>
<section id="what-is-jax" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-jax">What is JAX?</h2>
<p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">JAX</a> is a minor miracle. It will take python+numpy code and make it cool. It will let you JIT<sup>1</sup> compile it! It will let you differentiate it! It will let you batch<sup>2</sup>. JAX refers to these three operations as <em>transformations</em>.</p>
<p>But, as The Mountain Goats tell us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E4XeV33TvE"><em>God is present in the sweeping gesture, but the devil is in the details</em></a>. And oh boy are those details going to be really fucking important to us.</p>
<p>There are going to be two key things that will make our lives more difficult:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Not every operation can be transformed by every operation. For example, you can’t always JIT or take gradients of a <code>for</code> loop. This means that some things have to be re-written carefully to make sure it’s possible to get the advantages we need.</p></li>
<li><p>JAX arrays are <em>immutable</em>. That means that once a variable is defined it <em>cannot be changed</em>. This means that things like <code>a = a + 1</code> is not allowed! If you’ve come from an R/Python/C/Fortran world, this is the weirdest thing to deal with.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are really excellent reasons for both of these restrictions. And looking into the reasons is fascinating. But not a topic for this blog<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>JAX has some pretty decent<sup>4</sup> documentation, a core piece of which outlines some of the <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html">sharp edges</a> you will run into. As you read through the documentation, the design choices become clearer.</p>
<p>So let’s go and find some sharp edges together!</p>
</section>
<section id="to-jax-or-not-to-jax" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-jax-or-not-to-jax">To JAX or not to JAX</h2>
<p>But first, we need to ask ourselves <em>which functions do we need to JAX</em>?</p>
<p>In the context of our problem we, so far, have three functions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>_symbolic_factor_csc(A_indices, A_indptr)</code>, which finds the non-zero indices of the sparse Cholesky factor and return them in CSC format,</li>
<li><code>_deep_copy_csc(A_indices, A_indptr, A_x, L_indices, L_indptr)</code>, which takes the <em>entries</em> of the matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> and re-creates them so they can be indexed within the larger pattern of non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">,</li>
<li><code>_sparse_cholesky_csc_impl(L_indices, L_indptr, L_x)</code>, which actually does the sparse Cholesky factorisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take them piece by piece, which is also a good opportunity to remind everyone what the code looked like.</p>

<p>This function only needs to be computed once per non-zero pattern. In the applications I outlined in the first post, this non-zero pattern is <em>fixed</em>. This means that you only need to run this function <em>once</em> per analysis (unlike the others, that you will have to run once per iteration!).</p>
<p>As a general rule, if you only do something once, it isn’t all that necessary to devote <em>too much</em> time into optimising it. There are, however, some obvious things we could do.</p>
<p>It is, for instance, pretty easy to see how you would implement this with an explicit tree<sup>5</sup> structure instead of constantly <code>np.append</code>ing the <code>children</code> array. This is <em>far</em> better from a memory standpoint.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to imagine this as a two-pass algorithm, where you build the tree and count the number of non-zero elements in the first pass and then build and populate <code>L_indices</code> in the second pass.</p>
<p>The thing is, neither of these things fixes the core problem for using JAX to JIT this: the dimensions of the internal arrays depend on the <em>values</em> of the inputs. This is not possible.</p>
<p>It seems like this would be a huge limitation, but in reality it isn’t. Most functions aren’t like this one! And, if we remember that JAX is a domain language focussing mainly on ML applications, this is <em>very rarely</em> the case. It is always good to remember context!</p>
<p>So what are our options? We have two.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Leave it in Python and just eat the speed.</li>
<li>Build a <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/How_JAX_primitives_work.html">new JAX primitive</a> and write the XLA compilation rule<sup>6</sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Today are opting for the first option!</p>

<p>This is, fundamentally, a piece of bookkeeping. An annoyance of sparse matrices. Or, if you will, explicit <em>cast</em> between different sparse matrix types<sup>7</sup>. This is a thing that we do actually need to be able to differentiate, so it needs to live in JAX.</p>
<p>So where are the potential problems? Let’s go line by line.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>n = len(A_indptr) - 1</code>: This is lovely. <code>n</code> is used in a for loop later, but because it is a function of the <em>shape</em> of <code>A_indptr</code>, it is considered static and we will be able to JIT over it!</p></li>
<li><p><code>L_x = np.zeros(len(L_indices))</code>: Again, this is fine. Sizes are derived from shapes, life is peachy.</p></li>
<li><p><code>for j in range(0, n):</code>: This could be a problem if <code>n</code> was an argument or derived from <em>values</em> of the arguments, but it’s derived from a shape so it is static. Praise be! Well, actually it’s a bit more involved than that.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with the <code>for</code> loop is what will happen when it is JIT’d.&nbsp;Essentially, the loop will be statically unrolled<sup>8</sup>. That is fine for small loops, but it’s a bit of a pain in the arse when <code>n</code> is large.</p>
<p>In this case, we might want to use the structured control flow in <code>jax.lax</code><sup>9</sup> In this case we would need <code>jax.lax.fori_loop(start, end, body_fun, init_value)</code>. This makes the code look less <em>pythonic</em>, but probably should make it faster. It is also, and I cannot stress this enough, an absolute dick to use.</p>
<p>(In actuality, we will see that we do not need this particular corner of the language here!)</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><code>copy_idx = np.nonzero(...)</code>: This looks like it’s going to be complicated, but actually it is a perfectly reasonable composition of <code>numpy</code> functions. Hence, we can use the same <code>jax.numpy</code> functions with minimal changes. The one change that we are going to need to make in order to end up with a JIT-able and differentiable function is that we need to tell JAX how many non-zero elements there are. Thankfully, we know this! Because the non-zero pattern of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is a subset of the non-zero pattern of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">, we know that</li>
</ol>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="3">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1">np.in1d(L_indices[L_indptr[j]:L_indptr[j <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">+</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>]], A_indices[A_indptr[j]:A_indptr[j<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">+</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>]])</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>will have exactly <code>len(A_indices[A_indptr[j]:A_indptr[j+1]])</code> <code>True</code> values, and so <code>np.nonzero(...)</code> will have that many. We can pass this information to <code>jnp.nonzero()</code> using the optional <code>size</code> argument.</p>
<p><strong>Oh no! We have a problem!</strong> This return size is <em>a function of the values</em> of <code>A_indptr</code> rather than a function of the shape. This means we’re a bit fucked.</p>
<p>There are two routes out:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Declare <code>A_indptr</code> to be a static parameter, or</li>
<li>Change the representation from CSC to something more convenient.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case we could do either of these things, but I’m going to opt for the second option, as it’s going to be more useful going forward.</p>
<p>But before we do that, let’s look at the final line in the code.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><code>L_x[L_indptr[j] + copy_idx] = A_x[A_indptr[j]:A_indptr[j+1]]</code>: The final non-trivial line of the code is also a problem. The issue is that these arrays are <em>immutable</em> and we are asking to change the values! That is not allowed!</li>
</ol>
<p>The solution here is to use a clunkier syntax. In JAX, we need to replace</p>

</div>
<p>What is going on under the hood to make the second option ok while the first is an error is well beyond the scope of this little post. But the important thing is that they <em>compile down</em> to an in-place<sup>10</sup> update, which is all we really care about.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="re-doing-the-data-structure.">Re-doing the data structure.</h2>
<p>Ok. So we need a new data structure. That’s annoying. The rule, I guess, is always that if you need to innovate, you should innovate very little if you can get away with it, or a lot if you have to.</p>
<p>We are going to innovate only the tiniest of bits.</p>
<p>The idea is to keep the core structure of the CSC data structure, but to replace the <code>indptr</code> array with explicitly storing the row indices and row values as a <em>list</em> of <code>np.arrays</code>. So <code>A_index</code> will now be a <em>list</em> of <code>n</code> arrays that contain the row indices of the non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">, while <code>A_x</code>will now be a <em>list</em> of <code>n</code> arrays that contain the values of the non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">.</p>
<p>This means that the matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AB%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A1%20&amp;&amp;5%20%5C%5C%0A2&amp;3&amp;%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;4&amp;6%0A%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A"> would be stored as</p>

<p>This is a considerably more <em>pythonic</em><sup>11</sup> version of CSC. So I guess that’s an advantage.</p>

<p>So now it’s time to come back to that damn <code>for</code> loop. As flagged earlier, <code>for</code> loops can be a bit picky in JAX. If we use them <em>as is</em>, then the code that is generated and then compiled is <em>unrolled</em>. You can think of this as if the JIT compiler automatically writes a C++ program and then compiles it. If you were to examine that code, the for loop would be replaced by <code>n</code> almost identical blocks of code with only the index <code>j</code> changing between them. This leads to a potentially very large program to compile<sup>12</sup> and it limits the compiler’s ability to do clever things to make the compiled code run faster<sup>13</sup>.</p>
<p>The <code>lax.fori_loop()</code> function, on the other hand, compiles down to the equivalent of a single operation<sup>14</sup>. This lets the compiler be super clever.</p>
<p>But we don’t actually need this here. Because if you take a look at the original for loop we are just applying the same two lines of code to each triple of lists in <code>A_index</code>, <code>A_x</code>, and <code>L_index</code> (in our new<sup>15</sup> data structure).</p>
<p>This just <em>screams</em> out for a map applying a single function independently to each column.</p>
<p>The challenge is to find the right map function. An obvious hope would be <code>jax.vmap</code>. Sadly, <code>jax.vmap</code> does not do that. (At least not without more padding<sup>16</sup> than a drag queen.) The problem here is a misunderstanding of what different parts of JAX are for. Functions like <code>jax.vmap</code> are made for applying the same function to arrays <em>of the same size</em>. This makes sense in their context. (JAX is, after all, made for machine learning and these shape assumptions fit really well in that paradigm. They just don’t fit here.)</p>
<p>And I won’t lie. After this point I went <em>wild</em>. <code>lax.map</code> did not help. And I honest to god tried <code>lax.scan</code>, which is will solve the problem but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOGzY9xShEI">at what cost?</a>.</p>
<p>But at some point, you read enough of the docs to find the answer.</p>
<p>The correct answer here is to use the JAX concept of a <code>pytree</code>. Pytrees are essentially<sup>17</sup> lists of arrays. They’re very flexible and they have a <code>jax.tree_map</code> function that lets you map over them! We are saved!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-what-about-jit">But what about JIT?</h2>
<p>JIT took fucking <em>ages</em>. I’m talking “it threw a message” amounts of time. I’m not even going to pretend that I understand why. But I can hazard a guess.</p>
<p>My running assumption, taken from the docs, is that as long as the function only relies of quantities that are derived from the <em>shapes</em> of the inputs (and not the values), then JAX will be able to trace through and JIT through the functions with ease.</p>
<p>This might not be true for <code>tree_map</code>s. The docs are, as far as I can tell, silent on this matter. And a cursory look through the github repo did not give me any hints as to how <code>tree_map()</code> is translated.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look to see if this is true.</p>

<p>We can see that the first run includes compilation time, but after that it runs a bunch faster. This is how a JIT system is supposed to work! But the question is: will it recompile when we run it for a different matrix?</p>

<p>This gives us some hope! This is because the <em>structure</em> of A (aka <code>A_index</code>) is fixed in our application, but the values <code>A_x</code> changes. So as long as the initial JIT compilation is reasonable, we should be ok.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is something bad happening with the compilation. For <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=10">, it takes (on my machine) about 2 seconds for the initial compilation. For <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=20">, that increases to 16 seconds. Once <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20=%2030">, this balloons up to 51 seconds. Once we reach the lofty peaks<sup>18</sup> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=40">, we are up at 149 seconds to compile.</p>
<p>This is not good. The function we are JIT-ing is <em>very</em> simple: just one <code>tree_map</code>. I do not know enough<sup>19</sup> about the internals of JAX, so I don’t want to speculate too wildly. But it seems like it might be unrolling the <code>tree_map</code> before compilation, which is … bad.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-admit-failure">Let’s admit failure</h2>
<p>Ok. So that didn’t bloody work. I’m not going to make such broad statements as <em>you can’t use the JAX library in python to write a transformable sparse Cholesky factorisation</em>, but I am more than prepared to say that <em>I</em> cannot do such a thing.</p>
<p>But, if I’m totally honest, I’m not <em>enormously</em> surprised. Even in looking at the very simple operation we focussed on today, it’s pretty clear that the operations required to work on a sparse matrix don’t look an awful lot like the types of operations you need to do the types of machine learning work that is JAX’s <em>raison d’être</em>.</p>
<p>And it is <em>never</em> surprising to find that a library designed to do a fundamentally different thing does not easily adapt to whatever random task I decide to throw at it.</p>
<p>But there is a light: JAX is an extensible language. We can build a new JAX primitive (or, new JAX primitives) and manually write all of the transformations (batching, JIT, and autodiffing).</p>
<p>And that is what we shall do next! It’s gonna be a blast!</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>If you’ve never come across this term before, you can Google it for actual details, but the squishy version is that it will <em>compile</em> your code so it runs fast (like C code) instead of slow (like python code). JIT stands for <em>just in time</em>, which means that the code is compiled when it’s needed rather than before everything else is run. It’s a good thing. It makes the machine go <em>bing</em> faster.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I give less of a shit about the third transformation in this context. I’m not completely sure what you would batch when you’re dealing with a linear mixed-ish model. But hey. Why not.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>If you’ve ever spoken to a Scala advocate (or any other pure functional language), you can probably see the edges of why the arrays need to be immutable.<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphantom%7Ba%7D%0A"> Restrictions to JIT-able control flow has to do with how it’s translated onto the XLA compiler, which involves <em>tracing</em> through the code with an abstract data type with the same shape as the one that it’s being called with. Because this abstract data type does not have any values, structural parts of the code that <em>require</em> knowledge of specific values of the arguments will be lost. You can get around this partially by declaring those important values to be <em>static</em>, which would make the JIT compiler re-compile the function each time that value changes. We are not going to do that. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphantom%7Ba%7D%0A"> Restrictions to gradients have to do (I assume) with reverse-mode autodiff needing to construct the autodiff tree at compile time, which means you need to be able to compute the number of operations from the types and shapes of the input variables and not from their values.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Coverage is pretty good on the <em>using</em> bit, but, as is usual, the bits on extending the system are occasionally a bit … sparse. (What in the hairy Christ is a <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/How_JAX_primitives_work.html#transposition">transposition</a> rule actually supposed to do????)↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Forest↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>aka implement the damn thing in C++ and then do some proper work on it.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>It is useful to think of a sparse matrix type as the triple <code>(value_type, indices, indptr)</code>. This means that if we are going to do something like add sparse matrices, we need to first cast them both to have the same type. After the cast, addition of two different sparse matrices becomes the addition of their <code>x</code> attributes. The same holds for scalar multiplication. Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication is a bit different because you once again need to symbolically work out the sparsity structure (aka the type) of the product. ↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>I think. That’s certainly what’s implied <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#python-control-flow-jit">by the docs</a>, but I don’t want to give the impression that I’m sure. Because this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE">complicated.</a>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>What is <code>jax.lax</code>? Oh honey you don’t want to know.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>aka there’s no weird copying↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hRvQqyeI2g">Whatever that means anyway</a>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>slowwwwww to compile↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>The XLA compiler does very clever things. Incidentally, loop unrolling is actually one of the optimisations that compilers have in their pocket. Just not one that’s usually used for loops as large as this.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Read about XLA High Level Operations (HLOs) <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/architecture">here</a>. The XLA documentation is not extensive, but there’s still a lot to read.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>This is why we have a new data structure.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>My kingdom for a ragged array.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Yes. They are more complicated than this. But for our purposes they are lists of arrays.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=50"> takes so long it prints a message telling us what to do if we need to do if we want to file a bug! Compilation eventually clocks in at 361 seconds.↩︎</p></li>

<p>This is part two of an ongoing exercise in hubris. <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-22-a-linear-mixed-effects-model/">Part one is here.</a></p>
<section id="the-choleksy-factorisation" class="level1">
<h1>The Choleksy factorisation</h1>
<p>So first things first: Cholesky wasn’t Russian. I don’t know why I always thought he was, but you know. Sometime you should do a little googling first. Cholesky was French and died in the First World War.</p>
<p>But now that’s out of the way, let’s talk about matrices. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"><sup>1</sup> is a symmetric positive definite matrix, then there is a unique lower-triangular matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%20LL%5ET">.</p>
<p>Like all good theorems in numerical linear algebra, the proof of the existence of the Cholesky decomposition gives a pretty clear algorithm for constructing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">. To sketch<sup>2</sup> it, let us see what it looks like if build up our Choleksy factorisation from left to right, so the first <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j-1"> columns have been modified and we are looking at how to build the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th column. In order to make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> lower-triangular, we need the first <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j-1"> elements of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th column to be zero. Let’s see if we can work out what the other columns have to be.</p>
<p>Writing this as a matrix equation, we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20A_%7B11%7D%20&amp;%20a_%7B12%7D%20&amp;%20A_%7B32%7D%5ET%20%5C%5C%0Aa_%7B12%7D%5ET%20&amp;%20a_%7B22%7D%20&amp;%20a_%7B32%7D%5ET%20%5C%5C%0AA_%7B31%7D%20&amp;%20a_%7B32%7D%20&amp;%20A_%7B33%7D%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%20=%0A%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20L_%7B11%7D&amp;&amp;%20%5C%5C%0Al_%7B12%7D%5ET%20&amp;%20l_%7B22%7D&amp;%5C%5C%0AL_%7B31%7D%20&amp;%20l_%7B32%7D%20&amp;%20L_%7B33%7D%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7DL_%7B11%7D%5ET%20%20&amp;l_%7B12%7D%20&amp;%20L_%7B31%7D%5ET%5C%5C%0A&amp;%20l_%7B22%7D&amp;l_%7B32%7D%5ET%5C%5C%0A&amp;%20%20&amp;%20L_%7B33%7D%5ET%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7B11%7D"> is lower-triangular (and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%7B11%7D%20=%20L_%7B11%7DL_%7B11%7D%5ET">) and lower-case letters are vectors<sup>3</sup> and everything is of the appropriate dimension to make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%7B11%7D"> the top-left <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(j-1)%20%5Ctimes%20(j-1)"> submatrix of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">.</p>
<p>If we can find equations for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l_%7B22%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l_%7B32%7D"> that don’t depend on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7B33%7D"> (ie we can express them in terms of things we already know), then we have found an algorithm that marches from the left of the matrix to the right leaving a Choleksy factorisation in its wake!</p>
<p>If we do our matrix multiplications, we get the following equation for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_%7B22%7D%20=%20A_%7Bjj%7D">: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aa_%7B22%7D%20=%20l_%7B12%7D%5ETl_%7B12%7D%20+%20l_%7B22%7D%5E2.%0A"> Rearranging, we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Al_%7B22%7D%20%20=%20%5Csqrt%7Ba_%7B22%7D%20-%20l_%7B12%7D%5ETl_%7B12%7D%7D.%0A"> The canny amongst you will be asking “yes but is that a real number”. The answer turns out to be “yes” for all diagonals if and only if<sup>4</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is symmetric positive definite.</p>
<p>Ok! We have expressed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l_%7B22%7D"> in terms of things we know, so we are half way there. Now to attack the vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l_%7B3,2%7D">. Looking at the (3,2) equation implied by the above block matrices, we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aa_%7B32%7D%20=%20L_%7B31%7Dl_%7B12%7D%20+%20l_%7B32%7D%20l_%7B22%7D.%0A"> Remembering that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?l_%7B22%7D"> is a scalar (that we have already computed!), we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Al_%7B32%7D%20=%20(a_%7B32%7D%20-%20L_%7B31%7Dl_%7B12%7D)%20/%20l_%7B22%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>Success!</p>
<p>This then gives us the<sup>5</sup> Cholesky factorisation<sup>6</sup>:</p>
<pre><code>for j in range(0,n) (using python slicing notation because why notation)
  L[j,j] = sqrt(A[j,j] - L[j, 1:(j-1)] * L[j, 1:(j-1)]')
  L[(j+1):n, j] = (A[(j+1):n, j] - L[(j+1):n, 1:(j-1)] * L[j, 1:(j-1)]') / L[j,j]</code></pre>
<p>Easy as.</p>
<p>When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is a dense matrix, this costs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(n%5E3)"> floating point operations<sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>So how can we take advantage of the observation that most of the entries of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> are zero (aka <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is a sparse matrix)? Well. That is the topic of this post. In order, we are going to look at the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Storing a sparse matrix so it works with the algorithm</li>
<li>How sparse is a Cholesky factor?</li>
<li>Which elements of the Cholesky factor are non-zero (aka symbolic factorisation)</li>
<li>Computing the Cholesky factorisation</li>

<section id="so-how-do-we-store-a-sparse-matrix" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-how-do-we-store-a-sparse-matrix">So how do we store a sparse matrix?</h2>
<p>If we look at the Cholesky algorithm, we notice that we are scanning through the matrix column-by-column. When a computer stores a matrix, it stores it as a long 1D array with some side information. How this array is constructed from the matrix depends on the language.</p>
<p>There are (roughly) two options: column-major or row-major storage. Column major storage (used by Fortran<sup>8</sup>, R, Matlab, Julia, Eigen, etc) stacks a matrix column by column. A small example: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D1&amp;3&amp;5%5C%5C2&amp;4&amp;6%20%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5CRightarrow%20%5B1,2,3,4,5,6%5D.%0A"> Row-mjor ordering (C/C++ arrays, SAS, Pascal, numpy<sup>9</sup>) stores things row-by-row.</p>
<p>Which one do we use? Well. If you look at the Cholesky algorithm, it scans through the matrix column-by-column. It is much much much more memory efficient in this case to have the whole column available in one contiguous chunk of memory. So we are going to use column-major storage.</p>
<p>But there’s an extra wrinkle: Most of the entries in our matrix are zero. It would be very inefficient to store all of those zeros. You may be sceptical about this, but it’s true. It helps to realize that even in the examples at the bottom of this post that are not trying very hard to minimise the fill in, only 3-4% of the potential elements in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> are non-zero.</p>
<p>It is far more efficient to just store the locations<sup>10</sup> of the non-zeros and their values. If only 4% of your matrix is non-zero, you are saving<sup>11</sup> a lot of memory!</p>
<p>The storage scheme we are inching towards is called <em>compressed sparse column (CSC)</em> storage. This stores the matrix in three arrays. The first array <code>indices</code> (which has as many entries as there are non-zeros) stores the row numbers for each non-zero element. So if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AB%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A1%20&amp;&amp;5%20%5C%5C%0A2&amp;3&amp;%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;4&amp;6%0A%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A"> then (using zero-based indices because I’ve to to make this work in Python)</p>

<p>The second array <code>indptr</code> is an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n+1">-dimensional array that indexes the first element of each row. The final element of <code>indptr</code> is <code>nnz(B)</code><sup>12</sup>. This leads to</p>

<p>This storage scheme is very efficient for what we are about to do. But it is fundamentally a static scheme: it is <em>extremely</em> expensive to add a new non-zero element. There are other sparse matrix storage schemes that make this work better.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-sparse-is-a-cholesky-factor-of-a-sparse-matrix">How sparse is a Cholesky factor of a sparse matrix?</h2>
<p>Ok. So now we’ve got that out of the way, we need to work out the sparsity structure of a Choleksy factorisation. At this point we need to close our eyes, pray, and start thinking about graphs.</p>
<p>Why graphs? I promise, it is not because I love discrete<sup>14</sup> maths. It is because symmetric sparse matrices are strongly related to graphs.</p>
<p>To remind people, a graph<sup>15</sup> (in a mathematical sense) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D%20=%20(%5Cmathcal%7BV%7D,%20%5Cmathcal%7BE%7D)"> consists of two lists:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A list of vertices <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BV%7D"> numbered from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"><sup>16</sup>.</li>
<li>A list of edges <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BE%7D"> in the graph (aka all the pairs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%3Cj"> and there is an edge between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">).</li>
</ol>
<p>Every symmetric sparse matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> has a graph naturally associated with it. The relationship is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)"> (for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%5Cneq%20j">) is an edge in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D"> if and only if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%7Bij%7D%20%5Cneq%200">.</p>
<p>So, for instance, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AA%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A1&amp;2&amp;&amp;8%20%5C%5C%0A2&amp;3&amp;&amp;%205%5C%5C%0A&amp;&amp;4&amp;6%20%5C%5C%0A8&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7%0A%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D,%0A"></p>
<p>then we can plot the associated graph, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D">.</p>

</div>
<p>But why do we care about graphs?</p>
<p>We care because they let us answer our question for this section: <em>which elements of the Cholesky factor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> are non-zero?</em></p>
<p>It is useful to write the algorithm out for a second time<sup>17</sup>, but this time closer to how we will implement it.</p>

<p>If we stare at this long enough we can work out when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bij%7D"> is going to be potentially non-zero.</p>
<p>And here is where we have to take a quick zoom out. We are <em>not</em> interested if the numerical entry <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bij%7D"> is <em>actually</em> non-zero. We are interested if it <em>could be</em> non-zero. Why? Because this will allow us to set up our storage scheme for the sparse Cholesky factor. And it will tell us exactly which bits of the above loops we actually need to do!</p>
<p>So with that motivation in mind, can we spot the non-zeros? Well. I’ll be honest with you. I struggle at this game. This is part of why I do not like thinking about graphs<sup>18</sup>. But with a piece of paper and a bit of time, I can convince myslef that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_ij"> is potentially non-zero (or a <em>structural</em> non-zero) if:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%7Bij%7D"> is non-zero (because <code>tmp[i-j]</code> is non-zero!), or</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bik%7D%20%5Cneq%200"> <em>and</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bjk%7D%20%5Cneq%200"> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k%20%3C%20%5Cmin%5C%7Bi,%20j%5C%7D"> (because that is the only time an element of <code>tmp</code> is updated through <code>tmp[i] = tmp[i] - L[i, k] * L[j, k]</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we dig into the second condition a bit more,<sup>19</sup> we notice that the second case can happen if and only if there is a path in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D"><sup>20</sup> from node <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> to node <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ai%20%5Crightarrow%20v_1%20%5Crightarrow%20v_2%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cldots%20%5Crightarrow%20v_%7B%5Cell-1%7D%20%5Crightarrow%20j%0A"> with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_1,%20%5Cldots%20v_%7B%5Cell-1%7D%20%3C%20%5Cmin%5C%7Bi,j%5C%7D">. The proof is an induction on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmin%5C%7Bi,j%5C%7D"> that I can’t be arsed typing out.</p>
<p>(As an aside, Theorem 2.8 in <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Gaussian-Markov-Random-Fields-Theory-and-Applications/Rue-Held/p/book/9781584884323">Rue and Held’s book</a> gives a very clearn nice statistical proof of this result.)</p>
<p>This is enough to see that fill in patterns are going to be a complex thing.</p>

<p>The lesson is that the sparse Cholesky algorithm cares <em>deeply</em> about what order the rows and columns of the matrix are in. This is why, <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2022-03-22-a-linear-mixed-effects-model/">in the previous post</a>, we put the dense rows and columns of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q_%7Bu%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D"> at the <em>end</em> of the matrix!</p>
<p>Luckily, a lot of clever graph theorists got on the job a while back and found a number of good algorithms for finding decent<sup>23</sup> ways to reorder the vertices of a graph to minimise fill in. There are two particularly well-known reorderings: the approximate minimum degree (AMD) reordering and the nested-dissection reordering. Neither of these are easily available in Python<sup>24</sup>.</p>
<p>AMD is a bog-standard black box that is a greedy reordering that tries to label the next vertex so that graph you get after removing that vertex and adding edges between all of the nodes that connect to that vertex isn’t too fucked.</p>
<p>Nested dissection tries to generalise the toy example above by finding nodes that separate the graph into two minimally connected components. The separator node is then labelled last. The process is repeated until you run out of nodes. This algorithm can be very efficient in some cases (eg if the graph is planar<sup>25</sup>, the sparse Cholesky algorithm using this reordering <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01396660">provably costs</a> at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(n%5E%7B3/2%7D)">).</p>
<p>Typically, you compute multiple reorderings<sup>26</sup> and pick the one that results in the least fill in.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-elements-of-the-cholesky-factor-are-non-zero-aka-symbolic-factorisation">Which elements of the Cholesky factor are non-zero (aka symbolic factorisation)</h2>
<p>Ok. So I guess we’ve got to work out an algorithm for computing the non-zero structure of a sparse Cholesky factor. Naively, this seems easy: just use the Cholesky algorithm and mark which elements are non-zero.</p>
<p>But this is slow and inefficient. You’re not thinking like a programmer! Or a graph theorist. So let’s talk about how to do this efficiently.</p>
<section id="the-elimination-tree" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-elimination-tree">The elimination tree</h3>
<p>Let’s consider the graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_L"> that contains the sparsity pattern of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">. We <em>know</em> that the non-zero structure consists of all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%3C%20j"> and there is a path <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?in%20%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">. This means we could just compute that and make <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_L">.</p>
<p>The thing that you should notice immediately is that there is a lot of redundancy in this structure. Remember that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bik%7D"> is non-zero and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bjk%7D"> is also non-zero, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bij%7D"> is also non-zero.</p>
<p>This suggests that if we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,k)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(j,k)"> in the graph, we can remove the edge <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,j)"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D_L"> and still be able to work out that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7Bij%7D"> is non-zero. This new graph is no longer the graph associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> but, for our purposes, it contains the same information.</p>
<p>If we continue pruning the graph this way, we are going to end up with a<sup>27</sup> rooted tree! From this tree, which is called the <em>elimination tree</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"><sup>28</sup> we can easily work out the non-zero structure of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">.</p>
<p>The elimination tree is the fundamental structure needed to build an efficient sparse Cholesky algorithm. We are not going to use it to its full potential, but it is very cheap to compute (roughly<sup>29</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(%5Coperatorname%7Bnnz%7D(A))"> operations).</p>
<p>Once we have the elimination tree, it’s cheap to compute properties of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> like the number of non-zeros in a column, the exact sparsity pattern of every column, which columns can be grouped together to form supernodes<sup>30</sup>, and the approximate minimum degree reordering.</p>
<p>All of those things would be necessary for a modern, industrial-strength sparse Cholesky factorisation. But, and I cannot stress this enough, fuck that shit.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-symbolic-factorisation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-symbolic-factorisation">The symbolic factorisation</h3>
<p>We are doing the easy version. Which is to say I <em>refuse</em> to do anything here that couldn’t be easily done in the early 90s. Specifically, we are going to use the version of this that<a href="http://heath.cs.illinois.edu/courses/cs598mh/george_liu.pdf">George, Liu, and Ng</a> wrote about<sup>31</sup> in the 90s. Understanding this is, I think, enough to see how things like supernodal factorisations work, but it’s so much less to keep track of.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this method is that we compute the elimination tree implicitly as we go along.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D_j"> be the non-zero entries in the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th column of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">. Then our discussion in the previous section tells us that we need to determine the <em>reach</em> of the node i <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7BReach%7D(j,%20S_j)%20=%20%5Cleft%5C%7Bi:%20%5Ctext%7Bthere%20is%20a%20path%20from%20%7D%20i%5Ctext%7B%20to%20%7Dj%5Ctext%7B%20through%20%7DS_j%5Cright%5C%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_j%20=%20%5C%7B1,%5Cldots,%20j-1%5C%7D">.</p>
<p>If we can compute the reach, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D_j%20=%20%5Ctext%7BReach%7D(j,%20S_j)%20%5Ccup%5C%7Bj%5C%7D">!</p>
<p>This is where the elimination tree comes in: it is an efficient representation of these sets. Indeed, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%5Cin%20%5Ctext%7BReach%7D(j,%20S_j)"> <em>if and only if</em> there is a directed<sup>32</sup> path from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> in the elimination tree! Now this tree is ordered<sup>33</sup> so that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> is a child of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> (aka directly below it in the tree), then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20%3C%20j">. This means that its column in the Cholesky factorisation has already been computed. So all of the nodes that can be reached from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> by going through <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> are in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D_%7Bi%7D%20%5Ccap%20%5C%7Bj+1,%20%5Cldots,%20n%5C%7D">.</p>
<p>This means that we can compute the non-zeros of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th column of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> efficiently from the non-zeros of all of the (very few, hopefully) columns associated with the child nodes of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</p>
<p>So all that’s left is to ask “how can we find the child?” (as phones around the city start buzzing). Well, a little bit of thinking time should convince you that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap%20=%20%5Cmin%5C%7Bi%20:%20i%20%5Cin%20%5Ctext%7BReach%7D(j,%20S_j)%20%5C%7D,%0A"> then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> is the parent of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">. Or, the parent of column <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> is the index of its first<sup>34</sup> non-zero below the diagonal.</p>
<p>We can put all of these observations together into the following algorithm. We assume that we are given the non-zero structure of <code>tril(A)</code> (aka the lower-triangle of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">).</p>

<p>This was the first piece of Python I’ve written in about 13 years<sup>35</sup>, so it’s a bit shit. Nevertheless, it works. It is possible to replace the <code>children</code> structure by a linked list implemented in an n-dimensional integer array<sup>36</sup>, but why bother. This function is run once.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the <code>children</code> array expresses the elimination tree. If we were going to do something with it explicitly, we could just spit it out and reshape it into a more useful data structure.</p>
<p>There’s one more piece of tedium before we can get to the main event: we need to do a deep copy of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> into the data structure of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">. There is no<sup>37</sup> avoiding this.</p>

<p>It feels like we’ve been going for a really long time and we still don’t have a Cholesky factorisation. Mate. I feel your pain. Believe me.</p>
<p>But we are here now: everything is in place. We can now write down the Cholesky algorithm!</p>
<p>The algorithm is as it was before, with the main difference being that we now know two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We only need to update <code>tmp</code> with descendent of <code>j</code> in the elimination tree.</li>
<li>That’s it. That is the only thing we know.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, we could use the elimination tree to do this very efficiently, but, <em>as per my last email</em>, I do not care. So we will simply build up a copy of all of the descendants. This will obviously be less efficient, but it’s fine for our purposes. Let’s face it, we’re all going to die eventually.</p>

<p>The one thing that you’ll note in this code<sup>38</sup> is that we are implicitly using things that we know about the sparsity structure of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th column. In particular, we <em>know</em> that the sparsity structure of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th column is the <em>union</em> of the relevant parts of the sparsity structure of their dependent columns. This allows a lot of our faster indexing to work.</p>
<p>Finally, we can put it all together.</p>

<p>I was hoping that we were going to make it to the JAX implementation, but this is long enough now. And I suspect that there will be some <em>issues</em> that are going to come up.</p>

<p>Obviously this is a massive area and I obviously did not do it justice in a single blog post. It’s well worth looking further into. It is very cool. And obviously, <em>I go through all this</em><sup>41</sup> to get a prototype that I can play with all of the bits of. For the love of god, use Cholmod or Eigen or MUMPS or literally anything else. The only reason to write these yourself is to learn how to understand it.</p>

<div id="quarto-appendix" class="default"><section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"><h2 class="anchored quarto-appendix-heading">Footnotes</h2>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>The old numerical linear algebra naming conventions: Symmetric letters are symmetric matrices, upper case is a matrix, lower case is a vector, etc etc etc. Obviously, all conventions in statistics go against this so who really cares. Burn it all down.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Go girl. Give us nothing.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>or scalars↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This is actually how you check if a matrix is SPD. Such a useful agorithm!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>This variant is called the left-looking Cholesky. There are 6 distinct ways to rearrange these computations that lead to algorithms that are well-adapted to different structures. The left-looking algorithm is well adapted to matrices stored column-by-column. But it is not the only one! The variant of the sparse Cholesky in Matlab and Eigen is the upward-looking Cholesky. CHOLMOD uses the left-looking Cholesky (because that’s how you get supernodes). MUMPS uses the right-looking variant. Honestly this is a fucking fascinating wormhole you can fall down. A solid review of some of the possibilities is in Chapter 4 of Tim Davis’ book.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Here <code>A</code> is a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%5Ctimes%20n"> matrix and <code>u'</code> is the transpose of the vector <code>u</code>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>You can also see that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is stored in memory by stacking the columns, this algorithm is set up to be fairly memory efficient. Of course, if you find yourself caring about what your cache is doing, you’ve gone astray somewhere. That is why professionals have coded this up (only a fool competes with LAPACK).↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>The ultimate language of scientific computing. Do not slide into my DMs and suggest Julia is.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>You may be thinking <em>well surely we have to use a row-major ordering</em>. But honey let me tell you. We are building our own damn storage method, so we can order it however we bloody want. Also, somewhere down the line I’m going to do this in Eigen, which is column major by default.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>If you look at the algorithm, you’ll see that we only need to store the diagonal and the entries below. This is enough (in general) because we know the matrix is symmetric!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>CPU operations are a lot less memory-limited than they used to be, but nevertheless it piles up. GPU operations still very much are, but sparse matrix operations mostly don’t have the arithmetic intensity to be worth putting on a GPU.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>(NB: zero-based indexing!) This is a superfluous entry (the information is available elsewhere), but having it in makes life just a million times easier because you don’t have to treat the final column separately!.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>ZERO BASED, PYTHON SLICES↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>I am not a headless torso that can’t host. I differentiate.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>We only care about undirected graphs↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Or from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n-1"> if you have hate in your heart and darkness in your soul.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>To get from the previous version of the algorithm to this, we unwound all of those beautiful vectorised matrix-vector products. This would be a terrible idea if we were doing a dense Cholesky, but as general rule if you are implementing your own dense Cholesky factorisation you have already committed to a terrible idea. (The same, to be honest, is true for sparse Choleskys. But nevertheless, she persisted.)↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>or trees or really any discrete structure.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>Don’t kid yourself, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0205021">we look this shit up</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>This means that all of the pairs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i,%20v_1)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(v_i,%20v_%7Bi+1%7D)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(v_%7B%5Cell-1%7D,%20v_j)"> are all in the edge set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BE%7D">↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>The specific choices building this matrix are to make sure it’s positive definite. The transpose is there because in R, <code>R &lt;- chol(A)</code> returns an <em>upper</em> triangular matrix that satisfies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%20R%5ETR">. I assume this is because C has row-major storage, but I honestly don’t care enough to look it up.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>Here the <code>pivot = FALSE</code> option is needed because the default for a sparse Cholesky decomposition in R is to re-order the vertices to try to minimise the fill-in. But that goes against the example!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>Finding the minimum fill reordering is NP-hard, so everything is heuristic.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>scipy has the reverse Cuthill-McKee reordering—which is shit—easily available. As far as I can tell, the easiest way to get AMD out is to factorise a sparse matrix in scipy and pull the reordering out. If I were less lazy, I’d probably just bind SuiteSparse’s AMD algorithm, which is permissively licensed. But nah. The standard nested-dissection implementation is in the METIS package, which used to have a shit license but is now Apache2.0. Good on you METIS!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>and some other cases↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>They are cheap to compute↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>Actually, you get a forest in general. You get a tree if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D"> has a single connected component, otherwise you get a bunch of disjoint trees. But we still call it a tree because maths is wild.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>Fun fact: it is the spanning tree of the graph of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%20+%20L%5ET">. Was that fun? I don’t think that was fun.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>This is morally but not actually true. There is a variant (slower in practice, faster asymptotically), that costs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5Cleft(%5Coperatorname%7Bnnz%7D(A)%5Calpha(%5Coperatorname%7Bnnz%7D(A),%20n)%5Cright)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha(m,n)"> is the inverse Ackerman function, which is a very slowly growing function that is always equal to 4 for our purposes. The actual version that people use is technically <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(%5Coperatorname%7Bnnz%7D(A)%20%5Clog%20n)">, but is faster and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog%20n"> is never seen in practice.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>This is beyond the scope, but basically it’s trying to find groups of nodes that can be eliminated as a block using dense matrix operations. This leads to a much more efficient algorithm.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>There is, of course, a typo in the algorithm we’re about to implement. We’re using the correct version from <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0611010">here</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>from parent to child (aka in descending node order)↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>by construction↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>If there are no non-zeros below the diagonal, then we have a root of one of the trees in the forest!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>I did not make it prettier because a) I think it’s useful to show bad code sometimes, and b) I can’t be arsed. The real file has some comments in it because I am not a monster, but in some sense this whole damn blog is a code comment.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>The George, Liu, Ng book does that in FORTRAN. Enjoy decoding it.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>Well, there is some avoiding this. If the amount of fill in is small, it may be more efficient to do insertions instead. But again, I am not going to bother. And anyway. If <code>A_x</code> is a JAX array, it’s going to be immutable and we are not going to be able to avoid the deep copy.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>and in the deep copy code↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>This is the discretisation of a 2D laplacian on a square with some specific boundary conditions↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>Cholmod, which is the natural choice, is GPL’d, which basically means it can’t be used in something like Scipy. R does not have this problem.↩︎</p></li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Back in the early days of the pandemic I though “I’ll have a pandemic project”. I never did my pandemic project.</p>
<p>But I did think briefly about what it would be. I want to get the types of models I like to use in everyday life efficiently implemented inside Stan. These models encapsulate (generalised) linear mixed models<sup>1</sup>, (generalised) additive models, Markovian spatial models<sup>2</sup>, and other models. A good description of the types of models I’m talking about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00860">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these models can be solved efficiently via <a href="https://www.r-inla.org/">INLA</a><sup>3</sup>, a great R package for fast posterior inference for an extremely useful set of Bayesian models. In focussing on a particular class of Bayesian models, INLA leverages a bunch of structural features to make a very very fast and accurate posterior approximation. I love this stuff. It’s where I started my stats career.</p>
<p>None of the popular MCMC packages really implement the lessons learnt from INLA to help speed up their inference. I want to change that.</p>
<p>The closest we’ve gotten so far is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12550">nice work Charles Margossian has been doing</a> to get Laplace approximations into Stan.</p>
<p>But I want to focus on the other key tool in INLA: <em>using sparse linear algebra to make things fast and scalable</em>.</p>
<p>I usually work with Stan, but the scale of the C++ coding<sup>4</sup> required to even tell if these ideas are useful in Stan was honestly just too intimidating.</p>
<p>But the other day I remembered Python. Now I am a shit Python programmer<sup>5</sup> and I’m not fully convinced I ever achieved object permanence. So it took me a while to remember it existed. But eventually I realised that I could probably make a decent prototype<sup>6</sup> of this idea using some modern Python tools (specifically JAX). I checked with some PyMC devs and they pointed me at what the appropriate bindings would look like.</p>
<p>So I decided to go for it.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m pretty busy and these sort of projects have a way of dying in the arse. So I’m motivating myself by blogging it. I do not know if these ideas will work<sup>7</sup>. I do not know if my coding skills are up to it<sup>8</sup>. I do not know if I will lose interest. But it should be fun to find out.</p>
<p>So today I’m going to do the easiest part: I’m going to scope out the project. Read on, MacDuff.</p>
<section id="a-generalised-linear-mixed-effects-ish-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-generalised-linear-mixed-effects-ish-model">A generalised linear mixed effects-ish model</h2>
<p>If you were to open the correct textbook, or the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067i01">Bates, Mächler, Boler, and Walker 2015 masterpiece paper</a> that describes the workings of <code>lme4</code>, you will see the linear mixed model written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ay%20=%20X%5Cbeta%20+%20Zb%20+%20%5Cepsilon,%0A"> where</p>
<ul>
<li>the columns of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> contain the covariates<sup>9</sup>,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> is a vector of unknown regression coefficients,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> is a known matrix that describes the random effects (basically which observation is linked to which random effect),</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20%5CSigma_b)"> is the vector of random effects with some unknown covariance matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma_b">,</li>
<li>and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%20%5Csim%20N(0%20,%5Csigma%5E2%20W)"> is the observation noise (here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?W"> is a known diagonal matrix<sup>10</sup>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But unlike Doug Bates and his friends, my aim is to do Bayesian computation. In this situation, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> <em>also</em> has a prior on it! In fact, I’m going to put a Gaussian prior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20R)"> on it, for some typically known<sup>11</sup> matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R">.</p>
<p>This means that I can treat <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> the same<sup>12</sup> way! And I’m going to do just that. I’m going to put them together into a vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20=%20(%5Cbeta%5ET,%20b%5ET)%5ET">. Because the prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is Gaussian<sup>13</sup>, I’m sometimes going to call <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> the <em>Gaussian component</em> or even the <em>latent</em><sup>14</sup> Gaussian component.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve smooshed my fixed and random effects together, I don’t really need to keep <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> separate. So I’m going push them together into a rectangular matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AA%20=%20%5BX%20%5Cvdots%20Z%5D.%0A"></p>
<p>This allows us to re-write the model as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ay%20%5Cmid%20u,%20%5Csigma%20&amp;%20%5Csim%20N(A%20u,%20%5Csigma%5E2%20W)%5C%5C%0Au%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta%20&amp;%5Csim%20N(0,%20Q(%5Ctheta)%5E%7B-1%7D).%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p><em>What the hell is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ctheta)"> and why are we suddenly parameterising a multivariate normal distribution by the inverse of its covariance matrix (which, if you’re curious, is known as a <em>precision</em> matrix)???</em></p>
<p>I will take your questions in reverse order.</p>
<p>We are parameterising by the precision<sup>15</sup> matrix because it will simplify our formulas and lead to faster computations. This will be a major topic for us later!</p>
<p>As to what <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ctheta)"> is, it is the matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AQ(%5Ctheta)%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5CSigma_b%5E%7B-1%7D%20&amp;%200%20%5C%5C%200%20&amp;%20R%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%0A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta%20=%20(%5Csigma,%20%5CSigma_b)"> is the collection of all<sup>16</sup> non-Gaussian parameters in the model. Later, we will assume<sup>17</sup> that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma_b"> has quite a lot of structure.</p>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> generic model. It happily contains things like</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear regression!</li>
<li>Linear regression with horseshoe priors!</li>
<li>Linear mixed effects models!</li>
<li>Linear regression with splines (smoothing or basis)!</li>
<li>Spatial models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01180">ICARs, BYMs</a>, etc etc etc</li>
<li>Gaussian processes (with the caveat that we’re mostly focussing on those that can be formulated via precision matrices rather than covariance matrices. <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-24-getting-into-the-subspace/">A whole blog post, I have.</a>)</li>
<li>Any combination of these things!</li>
</ul>
<p>So if I manage to get this implemented efficiently, all of these models will become efficient too. All it will cost is a truly shithouse<sup>18</sup> interface.</p>
<p>The only downside of this degree of flexibility compared to just implementing a straight linear mixed model with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> all living separately is that there are a couple of tricks<sup>19</sup> to improve numerical stability that we can’t use.</p>
</section>
<section id="lets-get-the-posterior" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-get-the-posterior">Let’s get the posterior!</h2>
<p>The nice thing about thing about this model is that it is a normal likelihood with a normal prior, so we can directly compute two key quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “full conditional” distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(u%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta)">, which is useful for getting posterior information about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">, and</p></li>
<li><p>The marginal posterior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)">.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that we do not need to do MCMC on the joint space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u,%20%5Ctheta)">! We can instead write a model to draw samples from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)">, which is much lower-dimensional and easier<sup>20</sup> to sample from, and then compute the joint posterior by sampling from the full conditional.</p>
<p>I talked a little about the mechanics of this in a <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-10-14-priors2/">previous blog post about conjugate priors</a>, but let’s do the derivations. Why? Because they’re not too hard and it’s useful to have them written out somewhere.</p>
<section id="the-full-conditional" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-full-conditional">The full conditional</h3>
<p>First we need to compute <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(u%20%5Cmid%20y%20,%20%5Ctheta)">. The first thing that we note is that conditional distributions are always proportional to the joint distribution (we’re literally just pretending some things are constant), so we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ap(u%20%5Cmid%20y%20,%20%5Ctheta)%20&amp;%5Cpropto%20p(y%20%5Cmid%20u,%20%5Ctheta)%20p(u%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)%20p(%5Ctheta)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%5Cpropto%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Csigma%5E2%7D%20(y%20-%20Au)%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7D(y-Au)%5Cright%5D%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Du%5ETQ(%5Ctheta)u%5Cright%5D.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>Now we just need to expand things out and work out what the mean and the precision matrix of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(u%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%20)"> (which is Gaussian by conjugacy!) are.</p>
<p>Computing posterior distributions by hand is a dying<sup>21</sup> art. So my best and only advice to you: don’t be a hero. Just pattern match like the rest of us. To do this, we need to know what the density of a multivarite normal distribution looks like <em>deep</em> down in its soul.</p>
<p>Behold: the ugly <code>div</code> box!<sup>22</sup></p>
<div class="note">
<p>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20%5Csim%20N(m,%20P%5E%7B-1%7D)">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ap(u)%20&amp;%5Cpropto%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D(u%20-%20m)%5ETP(u-m)%5Cright%5D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%5Cpropto%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Du%5ETPu%20+%20m%5ETPu%5Cright%5D,%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> where I just dropped all of the terms that didn’t involve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">.</p>
</div>
<p>This means the plan is to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Expand out the quadratics in the exponential term so we get something that looks like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Du%5ETPu%20+%20z%5ETu%5Cright%5D"></li>
<li>The matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P"> will be the precision matrix of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta">.</li>
<li>The mean of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P%5E%7B-1%7Dz">.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let’s do it!</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ap(u%20%5Cmid%20y%20,%20%5Ctheta)%20&amp;%5Cpropto%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Csigma%5E2%7D%20u%5ETA%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7DAu%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D(A%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7Dy)%5ETu%5Cright%5D%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Du%5ETQ(%5Ctheta)u%5Cright%5D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%5Cpropto%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Du%5ET%5Cleft(Q%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7DA%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7DA%5Cright)u%20+%20%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D(A%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7Dy)%5ETu%5Cright%5D.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>This means that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(u%20%5Cmid%20y%20,%5Ctheta)"> is multivariate normal with</p>
<ul>
<li><p>precision matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%20=%20%5Cleft(Q(%5Ctheta)%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7DA%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7DA%5Cright)"> and</p></li>
<li><p>mean<sup>23</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D%20Q_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%5E%7B-1%7D%20A%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7Dy">.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means if I build an MCMC scheme to give me <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> samples <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta_b%20%5Csim%20p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b%20=%201,%20%5Cldots,%20B">, then I can turn them into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> samples <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Ctheta_b,%20u_b)"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta,%20u%20%5Cmid%20y)"> by doing the following.</p>

<p>So now we just<sup>25</sup> have to get the marginal posterior for the non-Gaussian parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta">.

<p>This is a very nice relationship between the functional forms of the various densities we happen to know and the density we are trying to compute. This means that if you have access to the full conditional distribution<sup>26</sup> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> you can marginalise <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> out. No weird integrals required.</p>
<p>But there’s one oddity: there is a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> on the right hand side, but no <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> on the left hand side. What we have actually found is a whole continuum of functions that are proportional to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)">. It truly does not matter which one we choose.</p>
<p>But some choices make the algebra slightly nicer. (And remember, I’m gonna have to implement this later, so I should probably keep and eye on that.)</p>
<p>A good<sup>27</sup> generic choice is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20=%20%5Cmu_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)">.</p>
<p>The algebra here can be a bit tricky<sup>28</sup>, so let’s write out each function evaluated at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20=%20%5Cmu_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)">.</p>

<p>Finally, we get that the denominator is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cmu_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta)%20%5Cpropto%20%7CQ_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%7C%5E%7B1/2%7D%0A"> as the exponential term<sup>29</sup> cancels!</p>
<p>Ok. Let’s finish this. (Incidentally, if you’re wondering why Bayesians love MCMC, this is why.)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-why-isnt-this-just-a-gaussian-process">So why isn’t this just a Gaussian process?</h2>
<p>These days, people<sup>31</sup> are more than passingly familiar<sup>32</sup> with Gaussian processes. And so they’re quite possibly wondering why this isn’t all just an extremely inconvenient way to do the exact same computations you do with a GP.</p>
<p>Let me tell you. It is <em>all</em> about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ctheta)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">.</p>
<p>The prior precision matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ctheta)"> is typically block diagonal. This special structure makes it pretty easy to compute the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7CQ(%5Ctheta)%7C"> term<sup>33</sup>. But, of course, there’s more going on here.</p>
<p>In linear mixed effects models, these blocks on the diagonal matrix are typically fairly small (their size is controlled by the number of levels in the variable you’re stratifying by). Moreover, the matrices on the diagonal of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ctheta)"> are the inverses of either diagonal or block diagonal matrices that themselves have quite small blocks<sup>34</sup>.</p>
<p>In models that have more structured random effects<sup>35</sup>, the diagonal blocks of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q(%5Ctheta)"> can get quite large<sup>36</sup>. Moreover, the matrices on these blocks are usually not block diagonal.</p>
<p>Thankfully, these prior precision matrices do have something going for them: most of their entries are zero. We refer to these types of matrices as <em>sparse matrices</em>. There are some marvelous algorithms for factorising sparse matrices that are usually a lot more efficient<sup>37</sup> than algorithms for dense matrices.</p>
<p>Moreover, the formulation here decouples the dimension of the latent Gaussian component from the number of observations. The data only enters the posterior through the reduction <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5ETy">, so if the number of observations is much larger than the number of latent variables<sup>38</sup> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is sparse<sup>39</sup>, the operation scales <em>linearly</em> in the number of observations (and obviously superlinearly<sup>40</sup> in the row-dimension of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A">).</p>
<p>So the prior precision<sup>41</sup> is a sparse matrix. What about the precision matrix of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Bu%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%5D">?</p>
<p>It is also sparse! Recall that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%20%5BZ%20%5Cvdots%20X%5D">. This means that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7DA%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7DA%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20Z%5ET%20W%5E%7B-1%7DZ%20&amp;%20Z%5ET%20W%5E%7B-1%7DX%20%5C%5C%20X%5ET%20W%5E%7B-1%7D%20Z%20&amp;%20X%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7DX%20%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D.%0A"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> is a matrix that links the stacked vector of random effects <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> to each observation. Typically, the likelihood <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(y_i%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)"> will only depend on a small number of entries of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b">, which suggests that most elements in each row of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> will be zero. This, in turn, implies that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> is sparse and so is<sup>42</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7DZ">.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the other three blocks are usually<sup>43</sup> fully dense. Thankfully, though, the usual situation is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> has <em>far</em> more elements that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">, which means that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7DA"> is still sparse and we can still use our special algorithms<sup>44</sup></p>
<p>All of this suggests that, under usual operating conditions, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q_%7Bu%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D"> is <em>also</em> a sparse matrix.</p>
<p>And that’s <em>great</em> because that means that we can compute the log-posterior using only 3 main operations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Computing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog(%7CQ(%5Ctheta)%7C)">. This matrix is block diagonal so you can just multiply together the determinants<sup>45</sup> of the diagonal blocks, which are relatively cheap to compute.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%7Bu%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)">. This requires solving the sparse linear system <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q_%7Bu%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D%20%5Cmu_%7Bu%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7DA%5ETW%5E%7B-1%7Dy">. This is going to rely on some fancy pants sparse matrix algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog(%7CQ_%7Bu%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta%7D(%5Ctheta)%7C)">. This is, thankfully, a by-product of the things we need to compute to solve the linear system in the previous task.</p></li>

<section id="what-i-what-i-what-i-gotta-do-what-i-gotta-do-to-get-this-model-in-pymc" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-what-i-what-i-gotta-do-what-i-gotta-do-to-get-this-model-in-pymc">What I? What I? What I gotta do? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqTSaMR75ns">What I gotta do to get this model in PyMC?</a></h2>
<p>So this is where shit gets real.</p>
<p>Essentially, I want to implement a new distribution in PyMC that will take approprite inputs and output the log-density and its gradient. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Panic</li>
<li>Pray</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first option, you write a C++<sup>46</sup> backend and register it as an Aesara node. This is how, for example, differential equation solvers migrated into PyMC.</p>
<p>For the second option, which is going to be our goal, we light our Sinead O’Connor votive candle and program up the model using JAX. JAX is a glorious feat of engineering that makes compilable and autodiff-able Python code. In a lot of cases, it seamlessly lets you shift from CPUs to GPUs and is all around quite cool.</p>
<p>It also has approximately zero useful sparse matrix support. (It will let you do <em>very</em> basic things<sup>47</sup> but nothing as complicated as we are going to need.)</p>
<p>So why am I taking this route? Well firstly I’m curious to see how well it works. So I am going to write JAX code to do all of my sparse matrix operations and see how efficiently it autodiffs it.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to pre-register my expectations. I expect it to be a little bit shit. Or, at least, I expect to be able to make it do better.</p>
<p>The problem is that computing a gradient requires a single reverse-mode<sup>48</sup> autodiff sweep. This does not seem like a problem until you look at how this sort of thing needs to be implemented and you realise that every gradient call is going to need to generate <em>and store</em> the entire damn autodiff tree for the log-density evaluation. And that autodiff tree is going to be <em>large</em>. So I am expecting the memory scaling on this to be truly shite.</p>
<p>Thankfully there are two ways to fix this. One of them is to implement a custom <em>Jacobian-vector product</em><sup>49</sup> and register it with JAX so it knows <em>most</em> of how to do the derivative. The other way is to implement this shit in C++ and register it as a JAX primitive. And to be honest I’m very tempted. But that is not where I am starting.</p>
<p>The other problem is going to be exposing this to users. The internal interface is going to be an absolute shit to use. So we are gonna have to get our Def Leppard on and sprinkle some syntactical sugar all over it.</p>
<p>I’m honestly less concerned about this challenge. It’s important but I am not expecting to produce anything good enough to put into PyMC (or any other package). But I do think it’s a good idea to keep this sort of question in mind: it can help you make cleaner, more useful code.</p>
<section id="what-comes-next" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-comes-next">What comes next?</h3>
<p>Well you will not get a solution today. This blog post is more than long enough.</p>
<p>My plan is to do three things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Implement the relevant sparse matrix solver in a JAX-able form. (This is mostly gonna be me trying to remember how to do something I haven’t done in a very long time.)</p></li>
<li><p>Bind<sup>50</sup> the (probably) inefficient version into PyMC to see how that process works.</p></li>
<li><p>Try the custom <code>jvp</code> and <code>vjp</code> interfaces in JAX to see if they speed things up relative to just autodiffing through my for loops.</p></li>
<li><p>(Maybe) Look into whether hand-rolling some C++ is worth the effort.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Will I get all of this done? I mean, I’m skeptical. But hey. If I do it’ll be nice.</p>

<li id="fn28"><p>A common mistake is to forget the parameter dependent proportionality constants from the normal distribution.

This is a generic property: the inverse of a sparse matrix is usually dense (it’s dense as long as the graph associated with the sparse matrix has a single connected component there’s a matrix with the same pattern of non-zeros that has a fully dense inverse) and the entries <a href="https://eudml.org/doc/130625">satisfy geometric decay bounds</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>Remember: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?W"> is diagonal and known.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>Not if you’re doing some wild dummy coding shit or modelling text, but typically.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>You’d think that dense rows and columns would be a problem but they’re not. A little graph theory and a little numerical linear algebra says that as long as they are the last variables in the model, the algorithms will still be efficient. That said, if you want to <em>dig in</em>, it is possible to use supernodal (eg CHOLMOD) and multifrontal (eg MUMPS) methods to group the operations in such a way that it’s possible to use level-3 BLAS operations. CHOLMOD even spins this into a GPU acceleration scheme, which is fucking wild if you think about it: sparse linear algebra rarely has the arithmetic intensity or data locality required to make GPUs worthwhile (you spend all of your time communicating, which is great in a marriage, terrible in a GPU). But some clever load balancing, tree-based magic, and multithreading <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750317312164">apparently makes it possible</a>. Like truly, I am blown away by this. We are not going to do <em>any</em> of this because absolutely fucking not. And anyway. It’s kinda rare to have a huge number of covariates in the sorts of models that use these complex random effects. (Or if you do, you better light your Sinead O’Connor votive candle because honestly you have a lot of problems and you’re gonna need healing.)↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn45"><p>If you’ve been reading the footnotes, you’ll recall that sometimes one of these precision matrices on the diagonal will be singular. Sometimes that’s because you fucked up your programming. But other times it’s because you’re using something like an ICAR (intrinsic conditional autoregressive) prior on one of your components. The precision matrix for this model is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q_%5Ctext%7BICAR%7D%20=%20%5Ctau_%5Ctext%7BICAR%7D%20=%20%5Ctau%20%5Ctext%7BAdj%7D(%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7BAdj%7D(%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D)"> is the adjacency matrix of some fixed graph <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D"> (typically describing something like which postcodes are next to each other). <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Gaussian-Markov-Random-Fields-Theory-and-Applications/Rue-Held/p/book/9781584884323">Some theory</a> suggests that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D"> has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> connected components, the zero determinant should be replaced with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%5E%7B(m%20-%20d)/2%7D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> is the number of vertices in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D">.↩︎</p></li>

<p><em>Every day a little death, in the parlour, in the bed. On the lips and in the eyes. In the curtains in the silver, in the buttons, in the bread, in the murmurs, in the pauses, in the gestures, in the sighs.</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snru5gtCyWA">Sondheim</a></p>

<p>The most horrible sound in the world is that of a reviewer asking you to compare your computational method to another, existing method. Like bombing countries in the name of peace, the purity of intent drowns out the voices of our better angels as they whisper: at what cost.</p>
<p>Before the unnecessary drama of that last sentence<sup>1</sup> sends you running back to the still-open browser tab documenting the world’s slow slide into a deeper, danker, more complete darkness that we’ve seen before, I should say that I understand that for most people this isn’t a problem. Most people don’t do research in computational statistics. Most people are happy<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>So why does someone asking for a comparison of two methods for allegedly computing the same thing fill me with the sort of dread usually reserved for climbing down the ladder into my basement to discover, by the the light of a single, swinging, naked light bulb, that the evil clown I keep chained in the corner has escaped? Because it’s almost impossible to do well.</p>
<section id="i-go-through-all-this-before-you-wake-up-so-i-can-feel-happier-to-be-safe-again-with-you" class="level1">
<h1>I go through all this before you wake up so I can feel happier to be safe again with you</h1>
<p>Many many years ago, when I still had all my hair and thought it was impressive when people proved things, I did a PhD in numerical analysis. These all tend to have the same structure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>survey your chosen area with a simulation study comparing all the existing methods,</p></li>
<li><p>propose a new method that should be marginally better than the existing ones,</p></li>
<li><p>analyse the new method, show that it’s at least not worse than the existing ones (or worse in an interesting way),</p></li>
<li><p>construct a simulation study that shows the superiority of your method on a problem that hopefully doesn’t look too artificial,</p></li>
<li><p>write a long discussion blaming the inconsistencies between the maths and the simulations on “pre-asymptotic artefacts”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Which is to say, I’ve done my share of simulation studies comparing algorithms.</p>
<p>So what changed? When did I start to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykdtNuKlHiA">the fear</a> every time someone mentioned comparing algorithms?</p>
<p>Well, I left numerical analysis and moved to statistics and I learnt the one true thing that all people who come to statistics must learn: statistics is hard.</p>
<p>When I used to compare deterministic algorithms it was easy. I would know the correct answer and so I could compare algorithms by comparing the error in their approximate solutions (perhaps taking into account things like how long it took to compute the answer).</p>
<p>But in statistics, the truth is random. Or the truth is a high-dimensional joint distribution that you cannot possibly know. So how can you really compare your algorithms, except possibly by comparing your answer to some sort of “gold standard” method that may or may not work.</p>
</section>
<section id="inte-ner-för-ett-stup.-inte-ner-från-en-bro.-utan-från-vattentornets-topp." class="level1">
<h1>Inte ner för ett stup. Inte ner från en bro. Utan från vattentornets topp<sup>3</sup>.</h1>
<p>The first two statistical things I ever really worked on (in an office overlooking a fjord) were computationally tractable ways of approximating posterior distributions for specific types of models. The first of these was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_National_Liberation_Army">INLA</a><sup>4</sup>. For those of you who haven’t heard of it, INLA (and it’s popular R implementation <a href="https://www.r-inla.org">R-INLA</a>) is a method for doing approximate posterior computation for a lot of the sorts of models you can fit in <code>rstanarm</code> and <code>brms</code>. So random effect models, multilevel models, models with splines, and spatial effects.</p>
<p>At the time, Stan didn’t exist (later, it barely existed), so I would describe INLA as being Bayesian inference for people who lacked the ideological purity to wait 14 hours for a poorly mixing BUGS chain to run, instead choosing to spend 14 seconds to get a better “approximate” answer. These days, Stan exists in earnest and that 14 hours is 20 minutes for small-ish models with only a couple of thousand observations, and the answer that comes out of Stan is probably as good as INLA.</p>
<p>Working on INLA I learnt a new fear: the fear that someone else was going to publish a simulation study comparing INLA with something else without checking with us first.</p>
<p>Now obviously, we wanted people to run their comparisons past us so we could ruthlessly quash any dissent and hopefully exile the poor soul who thought to critique our perfect method to the academic equivalent of a Siberian work camp.</p>
<p>Or, more likely, because comparing statistical models is really hard, and we could usually make the comparison much better by asking some questions about how it was being done.</p>
<p>Sometimes, learning from well-constructed simulation studies how INLA was failing lead to improvements in the method.</p>
<p>But nothing could be learned if, for instance, the simulation study was reporting runs from code that wasn’t doing what the authors thought it was<sup>5</sup>. And I don’t want to suggest that bad or unfair comparisons comes from malice (for the most part, we’re all quite conscientious and fairly nice), but rather that they happen because comparing statistical algorithms is hard.</p>
<p>And comparing algorithms fairly where you don’t understand them equally well is almost impossible.</p>

<section id="well-did-you-hear-the-one-about-mr-ed-he-said-im-this-way-because-of-the-things-ive-seen" class="level1">
<h1>Well did you hear the one about Mr Ed? He said I’m this way because of the things I’ve seen</h1>
<p>Why am I bringing this up? It’s because of the second statistical thing that I worked on while I was living in sunny Trondheim (in between looking at the fjord and holding onto the sides of buildings for dear life because for 8 months of the year Trondheim is a very pretty mess of icy hills).</p>
<p>During that time, I worked with <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~flindgre/">Finn Lindgren</a> and <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/haavard-rue">Håvard “INLA” Rue</a> on computationally efficient approximations to Gaussian random fields (which is what we’re supposed to call Gaussian Processes when the parameter space is more complex than just “time” [<em>shakes fist at passing cloud</em>]). Finn (with Håvard and Johan Lindström) had proposed a new method, cannily named the <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00777.x">Stochastic Partial Differential Equation</a> (SPDE) method, for exploiting the continuous-space Markov property in higher dimensions. Which all sounds very maths-y, but it isn’t.</p>
<p>The guts of the method says “all of our problems with working computationally with Gaussian random fields comes from the fact that the set of all possible functions is too big for a computer to deal with, so we should do something about that”. &nbsp;The “something” is replace the continuous function with a piecewise linear one defined over a fairly fine triangulation on the domain of interest.</p>
</section>
<section id="but-why-am-i-talking-about-this" class="level1">
<h1>But why am I talking about this?</h1>
<p>(Sorry. One day I’ll write a short post.)</p>
<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05013.pdf">very exciting paper popped up on arXiv on Monday</a><sup>6</sup> comparing a fairly exhaustive collection of recent methods for making spatial Gaussian random fields more computationally efficient.</p>
<p>Why am I not cringing in fear? Because if you look at the author list, they have included an author from each of the projects they have compared! This means that the comparison will probably be as good as it can be. In particular, it won’t suffer from the usual problem of the authors understanding some methods they’re comparing better than others.</p>
<p>#The world is held together by the wind that blows through Gena Rowland’s hair</p>
<p>So how did they go? Well, actually, they did quite well. I like that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They describe each problem quite well</p></li>
<li><p>The simulation study and the real data analysis uses a collection of different evaluations metrics</p></li>
<li><p>Some of these are proper scoring rules, which is the correct framework for evaluating probabilistic predictions</p></li>
<li><p>They acknowledge that the wall clock timings are likely to be more a function of how hard a team worked to optimise performance on this one particular model than a true representation of how these methods would work in practice.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="not-the-lovin-kind" class="level1">
<h1>Not the lovin’ kind</h1>
<p>But I’m an academic statistician. And our key feature, as a people, is that we loudly and publicly dislike each other’s work. Even the stuff we agree with. &nbsp;Why? Because people with our skills who also have impulse control tend to work for more money in the private sector.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, let’s have some fun.</p>
<p>(Although seriously, this is the best comparison of this type I’ve ever seen. So, really, I’m just wanting it to be even bester.)</p>
<p>So what’s wrong with it?</p>
</section>
<section id="its-gotta-be-big.-i-said-it-better-be-big" class="level1">
<h1>It’s gotta be big. I said it better be big</h1>
<p>The most obvious problem with the comparison is that the problem that these methods are being compared on is not particularly large or complex. You can see that from the timings. Almost none of these implementations are sweating, which is a sign that we are not anywhere near the sort of problem that would really allow us to differentiate between methods.</p>
<p>So how small is small? The problem had 105,569 observations and required prediction at at most&nbsp; 4,431 other locations. To be challenging, this data needed to be another order of magnitude bigger.</p>
</section>
<section id="god-knows-i-know-ive-thrown-away-those-graces" class="level1">
<h1>God knows I know I’ve thrown away those graces</h1>
<p>(Can you tell what I’m listening to?)</p>
<p>The second problem with the comparison is that the problem is tooooooo easy. As the data is modelled with a Gaussian observation noise and a multivariate Gaussian latent random effect, it is a straightforward piece of algebra to eliminate all of the latent Gaussian variables from the model. This leads to a model with only a small number of parameters, which should make inference much easier.</p>
<p>How do you do that? Well, if the data is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">, the Gaussian random field is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> and and all the hyperparmeters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta">. In this case, we can use conditional probability to write that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)%20%5Cpropto%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(y,x,%5Ctheta)%7D%7Bp(x%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Ctheta)%7D,%0A"> which holds for every value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> and particularly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x=0">. Hence if you have a closed form full conditional (which is the case when you have Gaussian observations), you can write the marginal posterior out exactly without having to do any integration.</p>
<p>A much more challenging problem would have had Poisson or binomial data, where the full conditional doesn’t have a known form. In this case you cannot do this marginalisation analytically, so you put much more stress on your inference algorithm.</p>
<p>I guess there’s an argument to be made that some methods are really difficult to extend to non-Gaussian observations. But there’s also an argument to be made that I don’t care. Shit or get off the pot, as American would say.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-take-me-back-to-the-range" class="level1">
<h1>Don’t take me back to the range</h1>
<p>The prediction quality is measured in terms of mean squared error and mean absolute error (which are fine), the continuous rank probability score (CRPS) and and the Interval Score (INT), both of which are proper scoring rules. <a href="https://sites.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/Gneiting2007jasa.pdf">Proper scoring rules</a> (and follow the link or google for more if you’ve never heard of them) are the correct way to compare probabilistic predictions, regardless of the statistical framework that’s used to make the predictions. So this is an excellent start!</p>
<p>But one of these measures does stand out: the prediction interval coverage (CVG) which is defined in the paper as “the percent of intervals containing the true predicted value”. I’m going to parse that as “the percent of prediction intervals containing the true value”. The paper suggests (through use of bold in the tables) that the correct value for CVG is 0.95. That is, the paper suggests the true value should lie within the 95% interval 95% of the time.</p>
<p><em>This is not true.</em></p>
<p>Or, at least, this is considerably more complex than the result suggests.</p>
<p>Or, at least, this is only true if you compute intervals that are specifically built to do this, which is mostly very hard to do. And you definitely don’t do it by providing a standard error (which is an option in this competition).</p>
<p>#Boys on my left side. Boys on my right side. Boys in the middle. And you’re not here.</p>
<p>So what’s wrong with CVG?</p>
<p>Why? Well first of all it’s a multiple testing problem. You are not testing the same interval multiple times, you are checking multiple intervals one time each. So it can only be meaningful if the prediction intervals were constructed jointly to solve this specific multiple testing problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s extremely difficult to know what is considered random here. Coverage statements are statements about repeated tests, so how you repeat them<sup>7</sup> will affect whether or not a particular statement is true. It will also affect how you account for the multiple testing when building your prediction intervals. (Really, if anyone did opt to just return standard errors, nothing good is going to happen for them in this criterion!)</p>
<p>Thirdly, it’s already covered by the interval score. If your interval is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Bl,u%5D"> with nominal level <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha">, the interval score is for an observation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7BINT%7D_%5Calpha(l,%20u,%20y)%20=%20u%20-%20l%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Calpha%7D(l-y)%20%5Cmathbf%7B1%7D%5C%7By%20%3C%20l%5C%7D%20+%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Calpha%7D(y-u)%5Cmathbf%7B1%7D%5C%7By%3Eu%5C%7D.%0A"> This score (where smaller is better) rewards you for having a narrow prediction interval, but penalises you every time the data does not lie in the interval. The score is minimised when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(y%20%5Cin%20%5Bl,u%5D)%20=%20%5Calpha">. So this really is a good measure of how well the interval estimate is calibrated that also checks more aspects of the interval than CVG (which lacks the first term) does.</p>

<h1>There’s the part you’ve braced yourself against, and then there’s the other part</h1>
<p>Any conversation about how to evaluate the quality of an interval estimate really only makes sense in the situation where everyone has constructed their intervals the same way. The authors’ code is <a href="https://github.com/finnlindgren/heatoncomparison/">here</a>, but even without seeing it we know there are essentially four options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Compute pointwise prediction means <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D_i"> and standard errors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Csigma%7D_i"> and build the pointwise intervals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D_i%20%5Cpm%201.96%5Chat%7B%5Csigma%7D">.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the pointwise Bayesian prediction intervals, which are formed from the appropriate quantiles (or the HPD region if you are Tony O’Hagan) of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cint%20%5Cint%20p(%5Chat%7By%7D%20%5Cmid%20x,%5Ctheta)%20p(x,%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)%5C,dx%20d%5Ctheta">.</p></li>
<li><p>An interval of the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D_i%20%5Cpm%20c%5Chat%7B%5Csigma%7D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> is chosen to ensure coverage.</p></li>
<li><p>Some sort of clever thing based on functional data analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But how well these different options work will depend on how they’re being assessed (or what they’re being used for).</p>
<section id="option-1-we-want-to-fill-in-our-sparse-observation-by-predicting-at-more-and-more-points" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-1-we-want-to-fill-in-our-sparse-observation-by-predicting-at-more-and-more-points">Option 1: We want to fill in our sparse observation by predicting at more and more points</h2>
<p>(This is known as “in-fill asymptotics”). This type of question occurs when, for instance, we want to fill in the holes in satellite data (which are usually due to clouds).</p>
<p>This is the case that most closely resembles the design of the simulation study in this paper. In this case you refine your estimated coverage by computing more prediction intervals and checking if the true value lies within the interval.</p>
<p>Most of the easy to find results about coverage in these is from the 1D literature (specifically around smoothing splines and non-parametric regression). In these cases, it’s known that the first option is bad, the second option will <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-21/issue-2/An-Analysis-of-Bayesian-Inference-for-Nonparametric-Regression/10.1214/aos/1176349157.full">lead to conservative regions</a> (the coverage will be too high), the third option involves <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-48116-6">some sophisticated understanding of how Gaussian random fields work</a>, and the fourth is not something I know anything about.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-2-we-want-to-predict-at-one-point-where-the-field-will-be-monitored-multiple-times" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-2-we-want-to-predict-at-one-point-where-the-field-will-be-monitored-multiple-times">Option 2: We want to predict at one point, where the field will be monitored multiple times</h2>
<p>This second option comes up when we’re looking at a long-term monitoring network. This type data is common in environmental science, where a long term network of sensors is set up to monitor, for example, air pollution. The new observations are not independent of the previous ones (there’s usually some sort of temporal structure), but independence can often be assumed if the observations are distant enough in time.</p>
<p>In this case as you are repeating observations at a single site, Option 1 will be the right way to construct your interval, option 2 will probably still be a bit broad but might be ok, and options 3 and 4 will probably be too narrow if the underlying process is smooth.</p>

<h1>I see the sun go down. I see the sun come up. I see a light beyond the frame.</h1>
<p>So what are my suggestions for making this comparison better (other than making it bigger, harder, and dumping the weird CVG criterion)?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>randomise</p></li>
<li><p>randomise</p></li>
<li><p>randomise</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What do I mean by that? Well in the simulation study, the paper only considered one possible set of data simulated from the correct model. All of the results in their Table 2, which contains the scores, and timings on the simulated data, depends on this particular realisation. And hence Table 2 is a realisation of a random variable that will have a mean and standard deviation.</p>
<p>This should <em>not</em> be taken as an endorsement of the frequentist view that the observed data is random and estimators should be evaluated by their average performance over different realisation of the data. <em>This is an acknowledgement of the fact that in this case the data is actually a realisation of a random variable.</em> Reporting the variation in Table 2 would give an idea of the variation in the performance of the method. And would lead to a more nuanced and realistic comparison of the methods. It is not difficult to imagine that for some of these criteria there is no clear winner when averaged over data sets.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-did-you-get-that-painter-in-your-pocket" class="level1">
<h1>Where did you get that painter in your pocket?</h1>
<p>I have very mixed feelings about the timings column in the results table. On one hand, an “order of magnitude” estimate of how long this will actually take to fit is probably a useful thing for a person considering using a method. On the other hand, there is just no way for these results not to be misleading. And the paper acknowledges this.</p>
<p>Similarly, the competition does not specify things like priors for the Bayesian solutions. This makes it difficult to really compare things like interval estimates, which can strongly depend on the specified priors. You could certainly improve your chances of winning on the CVG computation for the simulation study by choosing your priors carefully!</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-this-six-stringed-instrument-but-an-adolescent-loom" class="level1">
<h1>What is this six-stringed instrument but an adolescent loom?</h1>
<p>I haven’t really talked about the real data performance yet. Part of this is because <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/10/15/a-heart-full-of-hatred-8-schools-edition/">I don’t think real data is particularly useful for evaluating algorithms</a>. More likely, you’re evaluating your chosen data set as much as, or even more than, you are evaluating your algorithm.</p>
<p>Why? Because real data doesn’t follow the model, so even if a particular method gives a terrible approximation to the inference you’d get from the “correct” model, it might do very very well on the particular data set. I’m not sure how you can draw any sort of meaningful conclusion from this type of situation.</p>
<p>I mean, I should be happy I guess because the method I work on “won” three of the scores, and did fairly well in the other two. But there’s no way to say that wasn’t just luck.</p>
<p>What does luck look like in this context? It could be that the SPDE approximation is a better model for the data than the “correct” Gaussian random field model. It could just be Finn appealing to the old Norse gods. It’s really hard to tell.</p>
<p>If any real data is to be used to make general claims about how well algorithms work, I think it’s necessary to use <em>a lot</em> of different data sets rather than just one.</p>
<p>Similarly, a range of different simulation study scenarios would give a broader picture of when different approximations behave better.</p>

<section id="dont-dream-its-over" class="level1">
<h1>Don’t dream it’s over</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtvdZ47h8y4">One more kiss before we part</a>: This field is still alive and kicking. One of the really exciting new ideas in the field (that’s probably too new to be in the comparison) is that you can speed up the computation of the unnormalised log-posterior through <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04419">hierarchical decompositions of the covariance matrix</a> (there is also code). This is a really neat method for solving the problem and a really exciting new idea in the field.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of other things that are probably worth looking at in this article, but I’ve run out of energy for the moment. Probably the most interesting thing for me is that a lot of the methods that did well (SPDEs, Predictive Processes, Fixed Rank Kriging, Multi-resolution Approximation, Lattice Krig, Nearest-Neighbour Predictive Processes) are cut from very similar cloth. It would be interesting to look deeper at the similarities and differences in an attempt to explain these results.</p>

<p>It turns out that I did something a little controversial in <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-12-08-the-king-must-die-repost/">last week’s</a><sup>1</sup> post. As these things always go, it wasn’t the thing I was expecting to get push back from, but rather what I thought was a fairly innocuous scaling of the prior. <a href="http://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2017/11/02/king-must-die/#comment-601142">One commenter</a> (and a few other people on other communication channels) pointed out that the dependence of the prior on the design didn’t seem kosher. Of course, we (Andrew, Mike and I) wrote a paper that was sort of about this a <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/entropy-19-00555-v2.pdf">few months ago</a><sup>2</sup>, but it’s one of those really interesting topics that we can probably all deal with thinking more about.</p>
<p>So in this post, I’m going to go into a couple of situations where it makes sense to scale the prior based on fixed information about the experiment. (The emerging theme for these posts is “things I think are interesting and useful but are probably not publishable” interspersed with “weird digressions into musical theatre / the personal mythology of Patti LuPone”.)</p>
<p>If you haven’t clicked yet, this particular post is going to be drier than Eve Arden in Mildred Pierce. If you’d rather be entertained, I’d recommend <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2qY9GSG0nLoJdcQNmYxMGE">Tempting: Jenny Toomey sings the songs of Franklin Bruno</a>. (Franklin Bruno is today’s stand in for Patti, because I’m still sad that War Paint closed<sup>3</sup>. I only got to see it twice.)</p>
<p>(Jenny Toomey was one of the most exciting American indie musicians in the 90s both through her bands [Tsunami was the notable one, but there were others] and her work with Simple Machines, the label she co-founded. These days she’s working in musician advocacy and hasn’t released an album since the early 2000s. Bruno’s current band is called The Human Hearts. He has had a long solo career and was also in an excellent powerpop band called Nothing Painted Blue, who had an album called The Monte Carlo Method. And, now<sup>4</sup> that I live in Canada, I should say that that album has a fabulous cover of Mark Szabo’s I Should Be With You. To be honest, the only reason I work with Andrew and the Stan crew is that I figure if I’m in New York often enough I’ll eventually coincide with a Human Hearts concert<sup>5</sup>.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The first object of our affliction are priors that promote sparsity in high-dimensional models. There has been a lot of work on this topic, but the cheaters guide is basically this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While spike-and-slab models can exactly represent sparsity and have excellent theoretical properties, they are basically useless from a computational point of view. So we use scale-mixture of normal priors (also known as local-global priors) to achieve approximate sparsity, and then use some sort of decision rule to take our approximately sparse signal and make it exactly sparse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is a scale-mixture of normals? Well it has the general form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbeta_j%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20%5Ctau%5E2%20%5Cpsi%5E2_j),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> is a global standard deviation parameter, controlling how large the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> parameters are in general<sup>6</sup>, while the local standard deviation parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpsi_j"> control how big <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> is <em>relative</em> to the other <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">s.</p>
<p>The priors for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpsi_j"> are typically set to be independent. A lot of theoretical work just treats <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> as fixed (or as otherwise less important than the local parameters), but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05559">this is wrong</a>.</p>
<p><em>Pedant’s corner:</em> Andrew likes define mathematical statisticians as those who use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> for their data rather than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">. I prefer to characterise them by those who think it’s a good idea to put a prior on variance (an un-elicitable quantity) rather than standard deviation (which is easy to have opinions about). Please people just stop doing this. You’re not helping yourselves!</p>
<p>Actually, maybe that last point isn’t for Pedant’s Corner after all. Because if you parameterise by standard deviation it’s pretty easy to work out what the marginal prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> (with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> fixed) is.</p>
<p>This is quite useful because, with the notable exception of the “Bayesian” “Lasso” <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-12-08-the-king-must-die-repost/">which-does-not-work-but-will-never-die-because-it-was-inexplicably-published-in-the leading-stats-journal-by-prominent-statisticians-and-has-the-word-Lasso-in-the-title-even-though-a-back-of-the-envelope-calculation-or-I-don’t-know-a-fairly-straightforward-simulation-by-the-reviewers-should-have-nixed-it</a> (to use its married name), we can’t compute the marginal prior for most scale-mixtures of normals.</p>
<p>The following result, which was killed by reviewers at some point during the PC prior papers long review process, but lives forever <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4630v1">in the arXiv’d first version</a>, tells you everything you need to know.

<p>All of this basically says the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the density of the prior on the standard deviation is finite at zero, then the implied prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> has a logarithmic spike at zero.</p></li>
<li><p>If the density of the prior on the standard has a polynomial tail, then the implied prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> has the same polynomial tail.</p></li>
<li><p>Not in the result, but computed at the time: if the prior on the standard deviation is exponential, the prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> still has Gaussian-ish tails. I couldn’t work out what happened in the hinterland between exponential tails and polynomial tails, but I suspect at some point the tail on the standard deviation does eventually get heavy enough to be seen in the marginal, but I can’t tell you when.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With this sort of information, you can compute the equivalent of the bounds that I did on the Laplace prior for the general case (or, actually, for the case that will have at least a little bit of a chance, which is the monotonically decreasing priors on the standard deviation).</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-12-08-the-king-must-die-repost/">if you run the argument from the last post</a>, you see that you need a quite heavy tail on the standard deviation prior to get a reasonable prior on the implied sparsity. In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4630v4.pdf">we showed</a> that applying this reasoning to the horseshoe prior, where the prior on the local standard deviation is half-Cauchy, you can see that there is a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> that gives <em>a priori</em> weight on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%5E%7B-1%7D">-sparse signals, while also letting you have a few very large <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j">s.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For a very simple decision process (the deterministic threshold process described in the previous post), you can work out exactly how the threshold needs to interact with the prior. In particular, we can see that if we’re trying to detect a true signal that is exactly zero (no components are active), then we know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?latex%20%5C%7C%20%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%20%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%20%5C%7C%20=%200">. This is not possible for these scale-mixture models, but we can require that in this case all of the components are at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?latex%20%5Cepsilon">, in which case <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7C%20%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%20%5C%7C%20%5Cleq%20%5Cepsilon%20%5C%7C%20%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%20%5C%7C,%0A"> which suggests we want <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%20%5Cll%20%5C%7C%20%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%20%5C%7C_%5Cinfty%5E%7B-1%7D">. The calculation in the previous post shows that if we want this sort of almost zero signal to have any mass at all under the prior, we need to scale <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> using information about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D">.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a very very simple decision process. I have absolutely no idea how to repeat these arguments for actually good decision processes, like the predictive loss minimization <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01694">favoured by Aki</a>. But I’d still expect that we’d need to make sure there was a priori enough mass in the areas of the parameter space where the decision process is firmly one way or another (as well as <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2017/10/29/contour-as-a-verb/">mass in the indeterminate region</a>). I doubt that the Bayesian Lasso would magically start to work under these more complex losses.</p>

<p>So we can view the design dependence of sparsity priors as preparation for the forthcoming decision process. (Those of you who just mentally broke into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1SiaCV26aQ">Prepare Ye The Way Of The Lord</a> from Godspell, please come to the front of the class. You are my people.) Now let’s talk about a case where this isn’t true.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to cast our minds back to a time when people really did have the original cast recording of Godspell on their mind. In particular, we need to think about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqoeM18vCaU">Julian Besag</a> (who I’m sure was really into musicals about Jesus. I have no information to the contrary, so I’m just going to assume it’s true.) who wrote a series of important papers, one in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984812">1974</a> and one in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2987782">1975</a> (and several before and after, but I can’t be arsed linking to them all. We all have google.) about specifying models through conditional independence relations.</p>
<p>These models have a special place in time series modelling (where we all know about discrete-time Markovian processes) and in spatial statistics. In particular, generalisations of Besag’s (Gaussian) conditional autoregressive (CAR) models are w<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01180">idely used in spatial epidemiology</a>.</p>
<p>Mathematically, Gaussian CAR models (and more generally <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Gaussian-Markov-Random-Fields-Theory-and-Applications/Rue-Held/p/book/9781584884323">Gaussian Markov random fields</a> on graphs) are defined through their precision matrix, that is the inverse of the covariance matrix as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D%20%5Csim%20N(%5Cmathbf%7B0%7D,%20%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cmathbf%7BQ%7D%5E%7B-1%7D).%0A"></p>
<p>For simple models, such as the popular CAR model, we assume <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BQ%7D"> is fixed, known, and sparse (i.e.&nbsp;it has a lot of zeros) and we typically interpret <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> to be the inverse of the variance of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D">.</p>
<p>This interpretation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> could not be more wrong.</p>
<p>Why? Well, let’s look at the marginal distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ax_j%20%5Csim%20N%5Cleft(0,%20%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D%5BQ%5E%7B-1%7D%5D_%7Bii%7D%5Cright).%0A"></p>
<p>To interpet <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> and the inverse variance, we need the diagonal elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BQ%7D%5E%7B-1%7D"> to all be around 1. <em>This is never the case.</em></p>
<p>A simple, mathematically tractable example is the first order random walk on a one-dimensional lattice, which can be written in terms of the increment process as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ax_%7Bj+1%7D%20-%20x_j%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20%5Ctau%5E%7B-1%7D),%20%5Cqquad%20j%20=%201,%20%5Cldots%20J-1.%0A"></p>
<p>Conditioned on a particular starting point, this process looks a lot like a discrete version of Brownian motion as you move the lattice points closer together. This is a useful model for rough non-linear random effects, such as the baseline hazard rate in a Cox proportional hazard model. A long and detailed (and quite general) discussion of these models can be found in <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Gaussian-Markov-Random-Fields-Theory-and-Applications/Rue-Held/p/book/9781584884323">Rue and Held’s book</a>.</p>
<p>I am bringing this case up because you can actually work out the size of the diagonal of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BQ%7D%5E%7B-1%7D">. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211675313000407">Sørbye and Rue</a> talk about this in detail, but for this model maybe the easiest way to understand it is that if we had a fixed lattice with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> points and we’d carefully worked out a sensible prior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. Now imagine that we’ve gotten some new data and instead of only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> points in the lattice, we got information at a finer scale, so now the same interval is covered by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?nk"> equally spaced nodes. We model this with the new first order random walk prior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ax'_%7Bj+1%7D%20-%20x'_j%20%5Csim%20N(0,%5B%5Ctau'%5D%5E%7B-1%7D).%0A"></p>
<p>It turns out that we can relate the inverse variances of these two increment processes as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau'%20=%20J%20%5Ctau">.</p>
<p>This strongly suggests that we should not use the same prior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> as we should for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau'">, but that the prior should actually know about how many nodes there are on the lattice. Concrete suggestions are in the Sørbye and Rue paper linked above.</p>

<p>This type of design dependence is a general problem for multivariate Gaussian models specified through their precision (so-called Gaussian Markov random fields). The critical thing here is that, unlike the sparsity case, the design dependence does not come from some type of decision process. It comes from the gap between the parameterisation (in terms of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BQ%7D">) and the elicitable quantity (the scale of the random effect).</p>
<p>This is kinda a general lesson. <em>When specifying multivariate priors, you must always check the implications of your prior on the one- and two-dimensional quantities of interest. Because weird things happen in multivariate land!</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>So the design dependence doesn’t necessarily come in preparation for some kind of decision, it can also be because we have constructed (and therefore parameterised) our process in an inconvenient way. Let’s see if we can knock out another one before my bottle of wine dies.</p>
<p><a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/">Gaussian processes</a>, the least exciting tool in the machine learner’s toolbox, are another example where your priors need to be design dependent. It will probably surprise you not a single sausage that in this case the need for design dependence comes from a completely different place.</p>
<p>For simplicity let’s consider a Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(t)"> in one dimension with isotropic covariance function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ac(s,t)%20=%5Csigma%5E2%20(%5Ckappa%7Cs-t%7C)%5E%5Cnu%20K_%5Cnu(%7C%5Ckappa%7Cs-t%7C).%0A"></p>
<p>This is the commonly encountered Whittle-Matérn family of covariance functions. The distinguished members are the exponential covariance function when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20=%200.5"> and the squared exponential function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ac(s,t)=%20%5Csigma%5E2%5Cexp%5Cleft(%5Ckappa%20%7Cs-t%7C%5E2%20%5Cright),%0A"></p>
<p>which is the limit as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty">.</p>
<p>One of the inconvenient features of Matérn models in 1-3 dimensions is that it is impossible to consistently recover all of the parameters by simply observing more and more of the random effect on a fixed interval. You need to see new replicates in order to properly pin these down<sup>10</sup>.</p>
<p>So one might expect that this non-identifiability would be the source of some problems.</p>
<p>One would be wrong.</p>
<p>The squared exponential covariance function does not have this pathology, but it’s still very very hard to fit. Why? Well the problem is that you can interpret <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa"> as an inverse-range parameter. Roughly, the interpretation is that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%7Cs%20-%20t%20%7C%20%3E%20%5Cfrac%7B%20%5Csqrt%7B%208%20%5Cnu%20%7D%20%7D%7B%5Ckappa%7D%0A"> then the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> is approximately independent of the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(t)">.</p>
<p>This means that a fixed data set provides no information about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa"> in large parts of the parameter space. In particular if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa%5E%7B-1%7D"> is bigger than the range of the measurement locations, then the data has almost no information about the parameter.</p>
<p>Similarly, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa%5E%7B-1%7D"> is smaller than the smallest distance between two data points (or for irregular data, this should be something like “smaller than some low quantile of the set of distances between points”), then the data will have nothing to say about the parameter.</p>
<p>Of these two scenarios, it turns out that the inference is much less sensitive to the prior on small values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa"> (ie ranges longer than the data) than it is on small values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ckappa"> (ie ranges shorter than the data).</p>
<p>Currently, we have two recommendations: one based around <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00256">PC priors</a> and a very similar one based around <a href="https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_28/stan-users-guide/fit-gp.html#priors-gp.section">inverse gamma priors</a>. But both of these require you to specify the design-dependent quantity of a “minimum length scale we expect this data set to be informative about”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So in this final example we hit our ultimate goal. A case where design dependent priors are needed not because of a hacky decision process, or an awkward multivariate specification, but due to the limits of the data. In this case, priors that do not recognise the limitation of the design of the experiment will lead to poorly behaving posteriors. This manifests as the Gaussian processes severely over-fitting the data.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate expression of the point that we tried to make in the Entropy paper: <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/entropy-19-00555-v2.pdf">The prior can often only be understood in the context of the likelihood</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Just to round this off, I guess I should mention that the strong likelihood principle really does suggest that certain details of the design are not relevant to a fully Bayesian analysis. In particular, if the design only pops up in the normalising constant of the likelihood, it should not be relevant to a Bayesian. This seems at odds with everything I’ve said so far.</p>
<p>But it’s not.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, the design was only invoked in order to deal with some external information. For sparsity, design was needed to properly infer a sparse signal and came in through the structure of the decision process.</p>
<p>For the CAR models, the external information was that the elicitable quantity was the marginal standard deviation, which was a complicated function of the design and the standard parameter.</p>
<p>For Gaussian processes, the same thing happened: the implicit decision criterion was that we wanted to make good predictions. The design told us which parts of the parameter space obstructed this goal, and a well specified prior removed the problem.</p>
<p>There are also any number of cases in real practice where the decision at hand is stochastically dependent on the data gathering mechanism. This is why things like MRP exist.</p>
<p>I guess this is the tl;dr version of this post (because apparently I’m too wordy for some people. I suggest they read other things. Of course suggesting this in the final paragraph of such a wordy post is very me.):</p>
<p><em>Design matters even if you’re Bayesian. Especially if you want to do something with your posterior that’s more exciting than just sitting on it.</em></p>

<p>The thing is, I worry that the real problem in academic statistics in 2017 is not a reproducibility crisis, so much as that so many of our methods just don’t work. And to be honest, I don’t really know what to do about that, other than suggest that we tighten our standards and insist that people proposing new methods, models, and algorithms work harder to sketch out the boundaries of their creations. (What a suggestion. Really. Concrete proposals for concrete change. But it’s a blog. If ever there was a medium to be half-arsed in it’s this one. It’s like twitter for people who aren’t pithy.)</p>

<p>So what is the object of my impotent ire today. Well nothing less storied than the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/260-spring10/other-readings/park-casella.pdf">Bayesian Lasso</a>.</p>
<p>It should be the least controversial thing in this, the year of our lord two thousand and seventeen, to point out that this method bears no practical resemblance to the Lasso. Or, in the words of Law and Order: SVU, “The [Bayesian Lasso] is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event”.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-do-you-think-you-are">Who do you think you are?</h2>
<p>The Bayesian Lasso is a good example of what’s commonly known as the Lupita Nyong’o fallacy<sup>5</sup>, which goes something like this: Lupita Nyong’o had a break out role in Twelve Years a Slave, she also had a heavily disguised role in one of ’ the Star Wars films (the specific Star Wars film is not important. I haven’t seen it and I don’t care). Hence Twelve Years a Slave exists in the extended Star Wars universe.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The key point is that the (classical) Lasso plays a small part within the Bayesian Lasso (it’s the MAP estimate) in the same way that Lupita Nyong’o played a small role in that Star Wars film. But just as the presence of Ms Nyong’o does not turn Star Wars into Twelve Years a Slave, the fact that the classical Lasso can be recovered as the MAP estimate of the Bayesian Lasso does not make the Bayesian Lasso useful.</p>
<p>And yet people still ask <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2017/02/14/lasso-regression-etc-stan/">if they can be fit in Stan</a>. In that case, Andrew answered the question that was asked, which is typically the best way to deal with software enquiries<sup>7</sup>. But I am brave and was not asked for my opinion, so I’m going to talk about why the Bayesian Lasso doesn’t work.</p>
</section>
<section id="hiding-all-away" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hiding-all-away">Hiding all away</h2>
<p>So why would anyone not know that the Bayesian Lasso doesn’t work? Well, I don’t really know. But I will point out that all of the results that I’ve seen in this directions (not that I’ve been looking hard) have been published in the prestigious but obtuse places like Annals of Statistics, the journal we publish in when we either don’t want people without a graduate degree in mathematical statistics to understand us or when we want to get tenure.</p>
<p>By contrast, the original paper is very readable and published in JASA, where we put papers when we are ok with people who do not have a graduate degree in mathematical statistics being able to read them, or when we want to get tenure<sup>8</sup>.</p>
<p>To be fair to Park and Casella, they never really say that the Baysian Lasso should be used for sparsity. Except for one sentence in the introduction where they say the median gives approximately sparse estimators and the title which links it to the most prominent and popular method for estimating a sparse signal. Marketing eh. (See, I’m Canadian now<sup>9</sup>).</p>
<p>##The devil has designed my death and is waiting to be sure</p>
<p>So what is the Bayesian LASSO (and why did I spend 600 words harping on about something before defining it? The answer will shock you. Actually the answer will not shock you, it’s because it’s kinda hard to do equations on this thing<sup>10</sup>.)</p>
<p>For data observed with Gaussian error, the Bayesian Lasso takes the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbf%7By%7D%20%5Cmid%20%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%20%5Csim%20N(%20%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%20%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D,%20%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5CSigma%7D)%0A"></p>
<p>where, instead of putting a Normal prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D"> as we would in a bog-standard Bayesian regression, we instead use independent Laplace priors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cbeta_i)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Cexp(-%5Clambda%20%7C%20%5Cbeta_i%7C).%0A"></p>
<p>Here the tuning parameter<sup>11</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%20c(p,s_0,%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D)%5Ctilde%7B%5Clambda%7D"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> is the number of covariates, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_0"> is the number of “true” non-zero elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5CSigma%7D"> is known, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%7B%5Clambda%7D"> is an unknown scaling parameter that should be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(1)">.</p>
<p><em>Important Side note</em>: This isn’t the exact same model as Park and Castella used as they didn’t use the transformation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clambda%20=%20c(p,s_0,%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D)%20%5Ctilde%7B%5Clambda%7D%0A"> but rather just dealt with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> as the parameter. We will see below, and it’s born out by many papers in this field, that the best possible value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> will depend on this structural/design information</p>
<p>If we know how <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> varies as the structural/design information changes, it’s a much better idea to put a prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%7B%5Clambda%7D"> than on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> directly. Why? Because a prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> needs to depend on p, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_0">, and X and hence needs to be changed for each problem, while a prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%7B%5Clambda%7D"> can be used for many problems. One possible option is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c(p,s_0,%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D)%20=%202%5C%7C%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%5C%7C%5Csqrt%7B%5Clog%20p%20%7D">, which is a rate optimal parameter for the (non-Bayesian) Lasso. Later, we’ll do a back-of-the-envelope calculation that suggests we might not need the square root around the logarithmic term.</p>
<section id="why-do-we-scale-priors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-we-scale-priors">Why do we scale priors</h3>
<p>The critical idea behind the Bayesian Lasso is that <em>we can use the i.i.d. Laplace priors to express the substantive belief that the most of the</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> <em>are (approximately) zero</em>. The reason for scaling the prior is that the values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> that are consistent with this belief depend on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_0">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">.</p>
<p>For example, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%201">, the Bayesian Lasso will not give an approximately sparse signal.</p>
<p>While we could just use a prior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> that has a very heavy right tail (something like an inverse gamma), this is at odds with a good practice principle of making sure all of thee parameters in your models are properly scaled to make them order 1. Why do we do this? Because it makes it much much easier to set sensible priors.</p>
<p>Some of you may have noticed that the scaling <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c(p,s_0,%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D)"> can depend on the unknown sparsity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_0">. This seems like cheating. People who do asymptotic theory call this sort of value for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> an oracle value, mainly because people studying Bayesian asymptotics are really really into database software.</p>
<p>The idea is that this is the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> that gives the model the best chance of working. When maths-ing, you work out the properties of the posterior with the oracle value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> and then you use some sort of smoothness argument to show that the actual method that is being used to select (or average over) the parameter gives almost the same answer.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the scaling here doesn’t (directly<sup>12</sup>) depend on the number of observations, only the number of covariates. This is appropriate: it’s ok for priors to depend on things that should be known <em>a priori</em> (like the number of parameters) or things that can be worked with<sup>13</sup> (like the scaling of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">). It’s a bit weirder if it depends on the number of observations (that tends to break things like coherent Bayesian updating, while the other dependencies don’t).</p>

<p>So what’s wrong with the Bayesian Lasso? Well the short version is that the Laplace prior doesn’t have enough mass near zero relative to the mass in the tails to allow for a posterior that has a lot of entries that are almost zero and some entries that are emphatically not zero.<br>
Because the Bayesian Lasso prior does not have a spike at zero, none of the entries will be a priori exactly zero, so we need some sort of rule to separate the “zero” entries from the “non-zero” entries. The way that we’re going to do this is to choose a cutoff <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon"> where we assume that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7C%5Cbeta_j%7C%20%3C%5Cepsilon">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j%20=0">.</p>
<p>So how do we know that the Lasso prior doesn’t put enough mass in important parts of the parameter space? Well there are two ways. I learnt it during the exciting process of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4630">writing a paper</a> that the reviewers insisted should have an extended section about sparsity (although this was at best tangential to the rest of the paper), so I suddenly needed to know about Bayesian models of sparsity. So I read those Annals of Stats papers. (That’s why I know I should be scaling <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda">!).</p>
<p>What are the key references? Well all the knowledge that you seek is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.0735.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ejs/1460463652">here.</a></p>
<p>But a much easier way to work out that the Bayesian Lasso is bad is to do some simple maths.</p>
<p>Because the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> are a priori independent, we get a prior on the effective sparsity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_%5Cepsilon%20=%20%5C#%5C%7Bj%20:%20%7C%5Cbeta_j%7C%20%3E%20%5Cepsilon%5C%7D"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0As_%5Cepsilon%20%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BBin%7D(p,%20%5CPr(%7C%5Cbeta_j%7C%20%3E%20%5Cepsilon)).%0A"> For the Bayesian Lasso, that probability can be computed as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr%20(%20%7C%20%5Cbeta_j%20%7C%20%3E%20%5Cepsilon%20)%20=%20e%5E%7B-%20%5Clambda%20%5Cepsilon%7D,%0A"> so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0As_%5Cepsilon%20%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BBin%7D%5Cleft(p,%20e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%20%5Cepsilon%7D%5Cright).%0A"></p>
<p>Ideally, the distribution of this effective sparsity would be centred on the true sparsity.<br>
So we’d like to choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(s_%5Cepsilon)=%20p%20e%5E%7B-%20%5Clambda%20%5Cepsilon%7D=%20s_0.%0A"></p>
<p>A quick re-arrangement suggests that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clambda%20=%20%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-1%7D%20%5Clog(p)%20-%20%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-1%7D%20%5Clog(s_0).%0A"></p>
<p>Now, we are interested in signals with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_0%20=%20o(p)">, i.e.&nbsp;where only a very small number of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> are non-zero. This suggests we can safely ignore the second term as it will be much smaller than the first term.</p>
<p>To choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon">, we can work from the general principle that we want to choose it so that the effect of the “almost zero” <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bj:%7C%5Cbeta_j%7C%20%3C%20%5Cepsilon%7D%20%5Cbeta_j%20X_%7B:j%7D%0A"> is small. (here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_%7B:j%7D"> is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">th column of the matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">.)</p>
<p>From this, it’s pretty clear that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon"> is going to have to depend on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_0">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> as well! But how?</p>
<p>Well, first we note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bj:%7C%5Cbeta_j%7C%20%3C%20%5Cepsilon%7D%20%5Cbeta_j%20X_%7B:j%7D%20%5Cleq%20%5Cepsilon%20%5Cmax_%7Bi%20=1,%5Cldots,%20n%7D%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5Ep%20%7CX_%7Bij%7D%7C%20=%20%5Cepsilon%20%5C%7CX%5C%7C_%5Cinfty.%0A"> Hence we can make this asymptotically small (as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty">) if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cepsilon%20=%20o%5Cleft(%5C%7CX%5C%7C_%5Cinfty%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cright).%0A"> Critically, if we have scaled the design matrix so that each covariate is at most <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, ie <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmax_%7Bi=1,%5Cldots,n%7D%20%7CX_%7Bij%7D%7C%20%5Cleq%201,%20%5Cqquad%20%5Ctext%7Bfor%20all%20%7D%20j%20=%201,%5Cldots,%20p,%0A"> then this reduces to the much more warm and fuzzy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cepsilon%20=%20o%5Cleft(p%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cright).%0A"></p>
<p>This means that we need to take <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(p%20%5Clog(p))"> in order to ensure that we have our prior centred on sparse vectors (in the sense that the prior mean for the number of non-zero components is always much less than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">).</p>

</div>
<p>So for the Bayesian Lasso, a sensible parameter is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%20p%5Clog%20p">, which will usually have a large number of components less than the threshold <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon"> and a small number that are larger.</p>
<p>But this is still a bad prior.</p>
<p>To see this, let’s consider the prior probability of seeing a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta_j"> larger than one <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr%20(%20%7C%20%5Cbeta_j%20%7C%20%3E%201)%20=%20p%5E%7B-p%7D%20%5Cdownarrow%20%5Cdownarrow%20%5Cdownarrow%200.%0A"></p>
<p>This is the problem with the Bayesian Lasso: in order to have a lot of zeros in the signal, you are also forcing the non-zero elements to be very small. A plot of this function is above, and it’s clear that even for very small values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> the probability of seeing a coefficient bigger than one is crushingly small.</p>
<p>Basically, the Bayesian Lasso can’t give enough mass to both small and large signals simultaneously. Other Bayesian models (such as the horseshoe and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01694">Finnish horseshoe</a>) can support both simultaneously and this type of calculation can show that (although it’s harder. See Theorem 6 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4630.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>(The scaling that I derived in the previous section is a little different to the standard Lasso scaling of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda%20=%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%20(p%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Clog%20p%7D)">, but the same result holds: for large <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> the probability of seeing a large signal is vanishingly small.)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maybe-i-was-mean-but-i-really-dont-think-so">Maybe I was mean, but I really don’t think so</h2>
<p>This analysis is all very <em>back of the envelope</em>, but it contains a solid grain of truth<sup>14</sup>.</p>
<p>If you fit a Bayesian Lasso in Stan with an unknown scaling parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda">, you will not see estimates that are all zero, like this analysis suggests. This is because the posterior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> tries to find the values of the parameters that best fit the data <em>and not</em> the values that give an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon">-sparse signal.</p>
<p>In order to fit the data, it is important that the useful covariates have large <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">s, which, in turn, forces the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">s that should be zero to be larger than our dreamt of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon">.</p>
<p>And so you see posteriors constructed with the Bayesian Lasso exisiting in some sort of eternal tension: the small <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">s are too big, and the large <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbeta">s are typically shrunken towards zero.</p>
<p>It’s the sort of compromise that leaves everyone unhappy.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so.-gaussian-processes-eh.">So. Gaussian processes, eh.</h2>
<p><a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness.html">Now that we know what they are</a>, I guess we should do something with a Gaussian process. But we immediately hit a problem. You see, Gaussian processes are charming things, sweet and caring. But they have a dark side. Used naively<sup>1</sup>, they’re computationally expensive when you’ve got a lot of data.</p>
<p><strong>Stab of dramatic music</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. So. What’s the problem here? Well, the first problem is people seem to really like having a lot of data. Fuck knows why. Most of it is rubbish<sup>2</sup>. But they do.</p>
<p>This is a problem for our poor little Gaussian processes because of how the data tends to come.</p>
<p>A fairly robust model for data is that it comes like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(y_i,%20s_i,%20x_i),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i"> is our measurement of choice (which might be a continuous, discrete or weird<sup>3</sup>), <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_i"> is our location<sup>4</sup> in the index set<sup>5</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> (usually <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega%20%5Csubset%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed">) of the Gaussian process, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i"> is whatever other information we have<sup>6</sup>. If we want to be really saucy, we could also assume these things are iid samples from some unknown distribution and then pretend like that isn’t a wildly strong structural assumption. But I’m not like that. I’ll assume the joint distribution of the samples is exchangeable<sup>7</sup> <sup>8</sup> <sup>9</sup>. Or something. I’m writing this sequentially, so I have no idea where this is going to end up.</p>
<p>So where is the problem? The problem is that, if we use the most immediately computational definition of a Gaussian process, then we need to build <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20u(s_1)%5C%5C%20u(s_2)%20%5C%5C%20%5Cvdots%20%5C%5C%20u(s_n)%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5Csim%20N%5Cleft(%0A%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5Cmu(s_1)%5C%5C%20%5Cmu(s_2)%20%5C%5C%20%5Cvdots%20%5C%5C%20%5Cmu(s_n)%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D,%0A%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20c(s_1,%20s_1)%20&amp;%20c(s_1,%20s_2)%20&amp;%20%5Ccdots%20&amp;%20c(s_1,%20s_n)%20%20%5C%5C%20c(s_2,%20s_1)%20&amp;%20c(s_2,%20s_2)%20&amp;%20%5Ccdots%20&amp;%20c(s_2,%20s_n)%20%5C%5C%5Cvdots%20&amp;%5Cvdots%20%20&amp;%5Cddots%20&amp;%5Cvdots%20%5C%5C%20c(s_n,%20s_1)%20&amp;%20c(s_n,%20s_2)%20&amp;%20%5Ccdots%20&amp;%20c(s_n,%20s_n)%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%5Cright).%0A"> Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_1,%5Cldots,%20s_n"> are all of the <em>distinct</em> values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_i"> in the dataset. If there are a lot of these, the covariance matrix is <em>very</em> large and this becomes a problem. First, we must construct it. Then we must solve it. <em>Then</em> we must do actual computations with it. The storage scales quadratically in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">. The computation scales cubically in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">. This is too much storage and too much computation if the data set has a lot of distinct GP evaluations, it will simply be too expensive to do the matrix work that we need to do in order to make this run.</p>
<p>So we need to do something else.</p>

<section id="a-tangent-or-can-we-just-be-smarter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-tangent-or-can-we-just-be-smarter">A tangent; or Can we just be smarter?</h2>
<p>On a tangent, because straight lines are for poor souls who don’t know about Gaussian processes, there’s a body of work on trying to circumvent this problem by being good at maths. The idea is to try to find some cases where we don’t need to explicitly form the covariance matrix in order to do all of the calculations. There’s a somewhat under-cooked<sup>10</sup> literature on this. It dances around an idea that traces back to fast multipole methods for integral equations: We know that correlations decay as points get further apart, so we do not need to calculate the correlations between points that are far apart as well as we need to calculate the correlations between points that are close together. For a fixed covariance kernel that decays in a certain way, you can modify the fast multipole method, however it’s more fruitful to use an algebraic<sup>11</sup> method. H-matrices was the first real version of this, and there’s a <a href="https://ins.uni-bonn.de/media/public/publication-media/gpWithH2.pdf">paper from 2008</a> using them to approximate GPs. A solid chunk of time later, there have been two good papers recently on this stuff. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03215.pdf">Paper 1</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947319300374">Paper 2</a>. These methods really only provide gradient descent type methods for maximum likelihood estimation and it’s not clear to me that you’d be able to extend these ideas easily to a Bayesian setting (particularly when you need to infer some parameters in the covariance function)<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>I think this sort of stuff is cool for a variety of reasons, but I also don’t think it’s the entire solution. (There was also a 2019 NeurIPS paper that scales a GP fit to a million observations as if that’s a good idea. It is technically impressive, however.) But I think the main possibility of the H-matrix work is that it allows us to focus on the modelling and not have to make premature trade offs with the computation.</p>
<p>The problem with modelling a large dataset using a GP is that GPs are usually fit with a bunch of structural assumptions (like stationarity and isotropy) that are great simplifying assumptions for moderate data sizes but emphatically do not capture the complex dependency structures when there is a large amount of data. As you get more data, your model should become correspondingly more complex<sup>13</sup> and stationary, and/or isotropic Gaussian processes emphatically do not do this.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t use GPs on a large data set (I am very much on record as thinking you should), but that it needs to be a <em>part</em> of your modelling arsenal and probably not the whole thing. The real glory of GPs is that they are a flexible enough structure to play well with other modelling techniques. Even if you end up modelling a large data set with a single GP, that GP will most likely be anisotropic, non-stationary, and built up from multiple scales. Which is a different way to say that it likely does not have a squared exponential kernel with different length scales for each feature.</p>
<p>(It’s probably worth making the disclaimer at this point, but when I’m thinking about GPs, I’m typically thinking about them in 1-4 dimensions. My background is in spatial statistics, so that makes sense. Some of my reasoning doesn’t apply in more typical machine learning applications where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_i"> might be quite high-dimensional. That said, you simply get a different end of the same problem. In that case you need to balance the smoothness needed to interpolate in high dimensions with the structure needed to allow your variables to be a) scaled differently and b) correlated. Life is pain either way.)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-can-we-make-things-better">So can we make things better?</h2>
<p>The problem with Gaussian processes, at least from a computational point of view, is that they’re just too damn complicated. Because they are supported on some infinite dimensional Banach space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, the more we need to see of them (for instance because we have a lot of unique <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_i">s) the more computational power they require. So the obvious solution is to <em>somehow</em> make Gaussian processes less complex.</p>
<p>This <em>somehow</em> has occupied a lot of people’s time over the last 20 years and there are many many many many possible options. But for the moment, I just want to focus on one of the generic classes of solutions: You can make Gaussian processes less computationally taxing by making them less expressive.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way, if you choose an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> dimensional subspace <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m%20%5Csubset%20B"> and rep;ace the GP <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">, which is supported on the whole of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, with a <em>different</em> Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m"> supported on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m">, then all of your problems go away.</p>
<p>Why? Well because the Gaussian process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m"> can be represented in terms of an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">-dimensional Gaussian random vector. Just take <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi_j">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j=1,%5Cldots,%20m"> to be a basis for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m">, then the GP <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m"> can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Au_m%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5Em%20w_j%20%5Cphi_j,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w%20%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu,%20%5CSigma)">, for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma">. (The critical thing here is that the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi_j"> are functions so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m"> is still a random function! That link between the multivariate Gaussian <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> and the function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m"> that can be evaluated at any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_i"> is really important!)</p>
<p>This means that I can express my Gaussian process prior in terms of the multivariate Gaussian prior on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w">, and I only need <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(m%5E3)"> operations to evaluate its log-density.</p>
<p>If our observation model is such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(y_i%20%5Cmid%20u)%20=%20p(y_i%20%5Cmid%20u(s_i))">, and we assume conditional<sup>14</sup> independence, then we can eval the log-likelihood term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5En%20p(y%20%5Cmid%20u_m(s_i))%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5En%20p(y%20%5Cmid%20a_i%5ETw)%0A"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(m%5E2%20n)"> operations. Here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ba_i%5D_j%20=%20%5Cphi_j(s_i)"> is the vector that links the basis in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_n"> that we use to define <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> to the observation locations<sup>15</sup>.</p>
<p>Many have been tempted to look at the previous paragraph and conclude that a single evaluation of the log-posterior (or its gradient) will be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(n)">, as if that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%5E2"> multiplier were just a piece of fluff to be flicked away into oblivion.</p>
<p>This is, of course, sparkly bullshit.</p>
<p>The subspace size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> controls the trade off between bias and computational cost and, if we want that bias to be reasonably small, we need <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> to be quite large. In a lot of cases, it needs to grow with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00323.pdf">A nice paper by David Burt, Carl Rasmussen, and Mark van der Wilk</a> suggests that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m(n)"> needs to depend on the covariance function<sup>16</sup>. In the best case (when you assume your function is so spectacularly smooth that a squared-exponential covariance function is ok), you need something like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20=%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(%5Clog(n)%5Ed)">, while if you’re willing to make a more reasonable assumption that your function has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> continuous<sup>17</sup> derivatives, then you need something like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20=%20%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(n%5E%5Cfrac%7B2d%7D%7B2%5Cnu-d%7D)">.</p>
<p>You might look at those two options for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> and say to yourself “well shit. I’m gonna use a squared exponential from now on”. But it is never as simple as that. You see, if you assume a function is so smooth it is analytic<sup>18</sup>, then you’re assuming that it lacks the derring-do to be particularly interesting between its observed values<sup>19</sup>. This translates to relatively narrow uncertainty bands. Whereas a function with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> derivatives has more freedom to move around the smaller <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> is. This naturally results in wider uncertainty bands.</p>
<p>I think<sup>20</sup> in every paper I’ve seen that compares a squared exponential covariance function to a Matérn-type covariance function (aka the ones that let you have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">-times differentiable sample paths), the Matérn family has performed better (in my mind this is also in terms of squared error, but it’s definitely the case when you’re also evaluating the uncertainty of the prediction intervals). So I guess the lesson is that cheap isn’t always good?</p>
<p>Anyway. The point of all of this is that if we can somehow restrict our considerations to an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">-dimensional subspace of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, then we can get some decent (if not perfect) computational savings.</p>
<p>But what are the costs?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-notation-that-rapidly-degenerates-into-a-story-thats-probably-not-interesting">Some notation that rapidly degenerates into a story that’s probably not interesting</h2>
<p>So I guess the key question we need to answer before we commit to any particular approximation of our Gaussian process is <em>what does it cost?</em> That is, how does the approximation affect the posterior distribution?</p>
<p>To quantify this, we need a way to describe the posterior of a Gaussian process in general. As happens so often when dealing with Gaussian processes, shit is about to get wild.</p>
<p>A real challenge with working with Gaussian processes theoretically is that they are objects that naturally live on some (separable<sup>21</sup>) Banach space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">. One of the consequences of this is that we <em>cannot</em> just write the density of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(u)%20%5Cpropto%20%20%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DC_u(u,%20u)%5Cright)%0A"> because there is no measure<sup>22</sup> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A)%20=%20%5Cint_A%20p(u)%5C,du.%0A"></p>
<p>This means that we can’t just work with densities to do all of our Bayesian stuff. We need to work with posterior probabilities properly.</p>
<p>Ugh. Measures.</p>
<p>So let’s do this. We are going to need a prior probability associated with the Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">, which we will write as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmu_0(A)%20=%20%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is a nice<sup>23</sup> set in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">. We can then use this as a <em>base</em> for our posterior, which we define as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmu%5Ey(A)%20=%20%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A%20%5Cmid%20y)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D%5Cmathrm%7Be%7D%5E%7B-%5CPhi(u;y)%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPhi(u;y)"> is the negative log-likelihood function. Here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> is the normalising constant <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AZ%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%5Cmu%5Cleft(%20%5Cmathrm%7Be%7D%5E%7B-%5CPhi(u;y)%7D%5Cright),%0A"> which is finite as long as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cexp(-%5CPhi(u;y))%20%5Cleq%20C(%5Cepsilon)%5Cexp(%5Cepsilon%5C%7Cu%5C%7C%5E2)"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%20%3E%200">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C(%5Cepsilon)%5Cgeq%200"> is a constant. This is a <em>very</em> light condition.</p>
<p>This way of looking at posteriors resulting Gaussian process priors was popularised in the inverse problems literature<sup>24</sup>. It very much comes from a <em>numerical analysis</em> lens: the work is framed as <em>here is an object, how do we approximate it?</em>.</p>
<p>These questions are different to the traditional ones answered by a theoretical statistics papers, which are almost always riffs on <em>“what happens in asymptopia?”</em>.</p>
<p>I came across this work for two reasons: one is because I have been low-key fascinated by Gaussian measures ever since I saw a talk about them during my PhD; and secondly my PhD was in numerical analysis, so I was reading the journals when these papers came out.</p>
<p>That’s not why I explored these questions, though. That is a longer story. The tl;dr is</p>

<p>I had to learn this so I could show a particular point process model converges, and so now the whole rest of this blog post is contained in a technical appendix that no one has ever read in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0641">this paper</a>.</p>

Expand at your peril
</summary>
<p>I know these papers pretty much backwards for the usual academic reason: out of absolute spite. One of my postdocs involved developing some approximation methods for Markovian Gaussian processes<sup>25</sup>, which allowed for fast computation, especially when combined with INLA<sup>26</sup>, which is a fabulous method for approximating posterior distributions when a big chunk of the unobserved parameters have a joint Gaussian prior<sup>27</sup>.</p>
<p>One of the things that INLA was already pretty good at doing was fitting log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCP), which are a type of model for point patterns<sup>28</sup> that can be approximated over a regular grid by a Poisson regression with a log-mean given by (covariates +) a Gaussian process defined on the grid. If that process is Markov, you can get full posterior inference quickly and accurately using INLA. This compared very favourably with pre-INLA methods, which gave you full posterior inference laboriously using a truncated gradient MALA scheme in about the same amount of time it would take the US to get a high-speed rail system.</p>
<p>Anyway. I was in Trondheim working on INLA and the, at that stage, very new SPDE<sup>29</sup> stuff (the <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00777.x">2011 JRSSSB read paper</a> had not been written yet, let alone been read). <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/janineillian/">Janine Illian</a>, who is a very excellent statistician and an all round fabulous person, had been working on the grided LGCP stuff in INLA and came to Trondheim to work with Håvard<sup>30</sup> and she happened to give a seminar on using these new LGCP methods to do species distribution mapping. I was strongly encouraged to work with Janine to extend her grid methods to the new shiny SPDE methods, which did not need a grid.</p>
<p>Janine had to tell me what a Poisson distribution was.</p>
<p>Anyway. A little while later<sup>31</sup> we had a method that worked and we<sup>32</sup> wrote it up. We submitted it to Series B and they desk rejected it. We then, for obscure reasons<sup>33</sup>, submitted it to Biometrika. Due to the glory of arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0641v1.pdf">I can link to the original version</a>.</p>
<p>Although it was completely unlike anything else that Biometrika publishes, we got some quite nice reviews and either major revisions or a revise and resubmit. But one of the reviewer comments pissed me off: they said that we hadn’t demonstrated that our method converges. Now, I was young at the time and new to the field and kinda shocked by all of the shonky numerics that was all over statistics at the time. So this comment<sup>34</sup> pissed me off. More than that, though, I was fragile and I hated the comment because I was new to this and had absolutely no fucking idea how to prove this method would converge. Rasmus Waagepetersen <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167715203003079">had proven convergence of the grid approximation</a> but a) I didn’t understand the proof and b) our situation was so far away there was no chance of piggybacking off it.</p>
<p>It was also very hard to use other existing statistics literature, because, far from being an iid situation, the negative log-likelihood for a Poisson process<sup>35</sup> on an observation window <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPhi(u;y)%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20e%5E%7Bu(s)%7D%5C,ds%20-%20%5Csum_%7Bs_i%20%5Cin%20y%7De%5E%7Bu(s_i)%7D%20-%20%7C%5COmega%7C,%0A"> where the point pattern <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> is a (random) collection of points <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_j"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7C%5COmega%7C"> is the area/volume of the observation window. This is fundamentally not like a standard GP regression.</p>
<p>So, long story short<sup>36</sup>, I was very insecure and rather than admit that it was difficult to show that these approximations converged, I worked on and off for like 2 years trying to work out how to do this<sup>37</sup> and eventually came up with a fairly full convergence theory for posteriors derived from approximate likelihoods and finite dimensional approximations to Gaussian processes<sup>38</sup>. Which I then put into the appendix of a paper that was essentially about something completely different.</p>
<p>I don’t have all that many professional regrets (which is surprising because I’ve made a lot of questionable choices), but I do regret not just making that appendix its own paper. Because it was really good work.</p>
<p>But anyway, I took the inverse problems<sup>39</sup> work of Andrew Stuart and Masoumeh Dashti and extended it out to meet my needs. And to that end, I’m going to bring out a small corner of that appendix because it tells us what happens to a posterior when we replace a Gaussian process by a finite dimensional approximation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-we-measure-if-a-posterior-approximation-is-good">How do we measure if a posterior approximation is good?</h2>
<p>Part of the struggle when you’re working with Gaussian processes as actual objects rather than as a way to generate a single finite-dimensional Gaussian distribution that you use for analysis is that, to quote Cosma Shalizi<sup>40</sup>, <em>“the topology of such spaces is somewhat odd, and irritatingly abrupt”</em>. Or to put it less mathematically, it is <em>hard</em> to quantify which Gaussian processes are close together.</p>
<p>We actually saw this in the last blog where we noted that the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20=%20cu"> has no common support with the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7Cc%7C%20%5Cneq%201">. This means, for instance, that the total variation between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> is 2 (which is it’s largest possible value) even if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20=%201%20+%20%5Cepsilon"> for some <em>tiny</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon">.</p>
<p>More generally, if you’re allowed to choose what you mean by “these distributions are close” you can get a whole range of theoretical results for the posteriors of infinite dimensional parameters, ranging from <em>this will never work and Bayes in bullshit</em> to <em>everything is wonderful and you never have to worry</em>.</p>
<p>So this is not a neutral choice.</p>
<p>In the absence of a neutral choice, we should try to make a meaningful one! An ok option for that is to try to find functions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G(u)"> that we may be interested in. Classically, we would choose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> to be bounded (weak<sup>41</sup> convergence / convergence in distribution) or bounded Lipschitz<sup>42</sup>. This is good but it precludes things like means and variances, which we would quite like to converge!</p>
<p>The nice thing about everything being based off a Gaussian process is that we know<sup>43</sup> that there is some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%20%3E%200"> (which may be very small) such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_0%7D%5Cleft(%5Cmathrm%7Be%7D%5E%7B%5Cepsilon%20%5C%7Cu%5C%7C_B%5E2%7D%5Cright)%20%3C%20%5Cinfty.%0A"> This suggests that as long as the likelihood isn’t too evil, the posterior will also have a whole arseload of moments.</p>
<p>This is great because it suggests that we can be more ambitious than just looking at bounded Lipschitz functions. It turns out that we can consider convergence over the class of functionals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%7CG(u)%20-%20G(v)%7C%20%5Cleq%20L(u)%20%5C%7Cu%20-%20v%5C%7C_B,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_0%7D(L(u))%20%3C%20%5Cinfty">. Critically this includes functions like moments of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Cu%5C%7C_B"> and, assuming all of the functions in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> are continuous, moments of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)">. These <em>are</em> the functions we tend to care about!</p>

<section id="convergence-of-finite-dimensional-gaussian-processes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="convergence-of-finite-dimensional-gaussian-processes">Convergence of finite dimensional Gaussian processes</h2>
<p>In order to discuss the convergence of finite dimensional Gaussian processes, we need to define them and, in particular, we need to link them to some Gaussian process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> that they are approximating.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> be a Gaussian process supported on a Banach space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">. We define a <em>finite dimensional Gaussian process</em> to be a Gaussian process supported on some space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m%20%5Csubset%20B"> that satisfies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Au_n%20=%20R_m%20u,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m:%20B%20%5Crightarrow%20V_m"> is some operator. (For this to be practical we want this to be a family of operators indexed by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">.)</p>
<p>It will turn out that <em>how</em> this restriction is made is important. In particular, we are going to need to see how <em>stable</em> this restriction is. This can be quantified by examining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csup_%7B%5C%7Cf%5C%7C_V%20=%201%7D%20%5C%7CR_m%20f%5C%7C_%7BB%7D%20%5Cleq%20A_m%20%5C%7Cf%5C%7C_V,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_m%20%3E%200"> is a constant that could vary with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V%20%5Csubseteq%20B"> is some space we will talk about later. (Confusingly, I have set up the notation so that it’s not necessarily true that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m%20%5Csubset%20V">. Don’t hate me because I’m pretty, hate me because I do stupid shit like that.)</p>
<section id="example-1-an-orthogonal-truncation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-1-an-orthogonal-truncation">Example 1: An orthogonal truncation</h3>
<p>There is a prototypical example of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m">. Every Gaussian process on a separable Banach space admits a Karhunen-Loève representation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Au%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bk%20=%200%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Clambda_k%5E%7B1/2%7D%20z_k%20%5Cphi_k,%0A"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z_k"> are iid standard normal random variables and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%5Clambda_k,%20%5Cphi_k)"> are the eigenpairs<sup>44</sup> of the covariance operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_u">. The natural restriction operator is then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AR_m%20f%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bj=0%7D%5Em%20%5Clangle%20f,%20%5Cphi_j%5Crangle_%7BL%5E2%7D%5Cphi_j.%0A"> This was the case considered by Dashti and Stuart in their 2011 paper. Although it’s prototypical, we typically do not work with the Karhunen-Loève basis directly, as it tends to commit us to a domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega">. (Also because we almost<sup>45</sup> never know what the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi_j"> are.)</p>
<p>Because this truncation is an orthogonal projection, it follows that we have the stability bound with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_m%20=%201"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">.</p>

<p>Maybe a more interesting example is the <em>subset of regressors</em><sup>46</sup>.

<p>It’s a bit harder to get the stability result in this case.

<p>Assuming that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> contains continuous functions, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Cb%5C%7C_2%20%5Cleq%20C%5Csqrt%7Bm%7D%20%5C%7Cf%5C%7C_B">. I’m pretty lazy so I’m choosing not to give a shit about that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7Bm%7D"> but I doubt it’s unimprovable<sup>48</sup>. To be honest, I haven’t thought deeply about these bounds, I am doing them live, on my couch, after a couple of red wines. If you want a good complexity analysis of subset of regressors, google.</p>
<p>More interestingly, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7CK_m%5E%7B-1%7D%5C%7C_2"> can be bounded, under mild conditions on the locations of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_j"> by the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">-th largest eigenvalue of the operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Kf%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20r_u(s,t)f(t)%5C,dt">.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-3-the-spde-method">Example 3: The SPDE method</h3>
<p>My personal favourite way to approximate Gaussian processes works when they are <em>Markovian</em>. The Markov property, in general, says that if, for every<sup>49</sup> set of disjoint open domains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_2%20=%20%5COmega%20%5Cbackslash%20%5Cbar%20S_1"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_1%20%5Ccup%20%5CGamma%20%5Ccup%20S_2">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CGamma"> is the <em>boundary</em> between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_2">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(A_1%20%5Ccup%20A_2%20%5Cmid%20B_%5Cepsilon)%20=%20%5CPr(A_1%20%5Cmid%20B_%5Cepsilon)%20%5CPr(A_2%20%5Cmid%20B_%5Cepsilon),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_j%20%5Cin%20%5Csigma%5Cleft(%5C%7Bu(s),%20s%20%5Cin%20S_j%5C%7D%5Cright)"> and<sup>50</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_%5Cepsilon%20%5Cin%20%5Csigma%5Cleft(%5C%7Bu(s);%20d(s,%20%5CGamma)%20%3C%20%5Cepsilon%5C%7D%5Cright)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%3E0">.</p>
<p>Which is to say that it’s the normal Markov property, but you may need to fatten out the boundary between disjoint domains infinitesimally for it to work.</p>
<p>In this case, we<sup>51</sup> know that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space has the property that the inner product is <em>local</em>. That means that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g"> are in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_u"> and have disjoint support<sup>52</sup> then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clangle%20f,%20g%5Crangle_%7BH_u%7D%20=%200,%0A"> which, if you squint, implies that the precision operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D"> is a differential operator. (That the RKHS inner product being local basically defines the Markov property.)</p>
<p>We are going to consider a special case<sup>53</sup>, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> solves the partial differential equation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AL%20u%20=%20W,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> is some differential operator and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?W"> is <em>white noise</em><sup>54</sup>.</p>
<p>We make sense of this equation by saying a Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> solves it if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_%5COmega%20%5Cleft(L%5E*%5Cphi(s)%5Cright)%5Cleft(%20u(s)%5Cright)%5C,ds%20%20%5Csim%20N%5Cleft(0,%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20%5Cphi%5E2(s)%5C,ds%5Cright),%0A"> for every smooth function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E*"> is the adjoint of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> (we need to do this because, in general, the derivatives of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> could be a bit funky).</p>
<p>If we are willing to believe this exists (it does—it’s a linear filter of white noise, electrical engineers would die if it didn’t) then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is a Gaussian process with zero mean and covariance operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%20=%20(L%5E*L)%5E%7B-1%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E*"> is the adjoint of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">.</p>
<p>This all seems like an awful lot of work, but it’s the basis of one of the more powerful methods for approximating Gaussian processes on low-dimensional spaces (or low-dimensional manifolds). In particular in 1-3 dimensions<sup>55</sup> or in (1-3)+1 dimensions<sup>56</sup> (as in space-time), Gaussian processes that are built this way can be extremely efficient.</p>
<p>This representation was probably first found by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/41/3-4/434/230856?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Peter Whittle</a> and <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00777.x">Finn Lindgren, Johan Lindström and Håvard Rue</a> combined it with the finite element method to produce the SPDE method<sup>57</sup> A good review of the work that’s been done can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01084.pdf">found here</a>. There’s also a whole literature on linear filters and stochastic processes.</p>
<p>We can use this <em>SDPE</em> representation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> to construct a finite-dimensional Gaussian process and a restriction operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m">. To do this, we define <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_m"> as the operator defined implicitly through the equation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clangle%20%5Cphi,%20L%5Cpsi%5Crangle_%7BL%5E2%7D%20=%20%5Clangle%20%5Cphi,%20L_m%5Cpsi%5Crangle_%7BL%5E2%7D,%20%5Cquad%20%5Cforall%20%5Cphi,%5Cpsi%20%5Cin%20V_m.%0A"> This is often called the Galerkin projection<sup>58</sup>. It is at the heart of the finite element method for solving elliptic partial differential equations.</p>
<p>We can use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_m"> to construct a Gaussian process with covariance function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_m%20=%20(L_m%5E*L_m)%5E%5Cdagger,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5E%5Cdagger"> is a pseudo-inverse<sup>59</sup>.</p>
<p>It follows that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_m%20%20=(L_m)%5E%5Cdagger%20L%20L%5E%7B-1%7D(L%5E*)%5E%7B-1%7DL%5E*(L_m%5E*)%5E%5Cdagger%20=%20R_m%20%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%20R_m%5E*,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m%20=%20L_m%5E%5Cdagger%20L">.</p>
<p>Before we can get a stability estimate, we definitely need to choose our space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m">. In general, the space will depend on the order of the PDE<sup>60</sup>, so to make things concrete we will work with second-order elliptic<sup>61</sup> PDE <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ALu%20=%20-%5Csum_%7Bi,j%20=%201%7D%5Ed%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20s_j%7D%5Cleft(a_%7Bij%7D(s)%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20u%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20s_i%7D%20%5Cright)%20+%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5Ed%20b_i%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20u%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20s_i%7D%20+%20b_0(s)u(s),%0A"> where all of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_%7Bij%7D(s)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_j(s)"> are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%5Cinfty(%5COmega)"> and the uniform ellipticity condition<sup>62</sup> holds.</p>
<p>These operators induce (potentially non-stationary) Gaussian processes that have continuous versions as long as<sup>63</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d%20%5Cleq%203">.</p>
<p>With this fixed, the natural finite element space to use is the space of continuous piecewise linear functions. Traditionally, this is done using combinations of tent functions on a triangular mesh.</p>

<p>With this basis, we can get stability estimates by defining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_m"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Lv%20=%20f"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_m%20v_m%20=%20f_m">, from which we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7CR_m%20v%5C%7C_B%20=%20%5C%7Cv_m%5C%7C_%7BV_m%7D%20%5Cleq%20A%5C%7Cf%5C%7C_%7BL_2%7D%0A"> which holds, in particular, when the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> has no first order derivatives<sup>64</sup>.</p>
<p>An oddity about this structure is that functions in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m"> are not not continuously differentiable, while the sample paths of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> almost surely are<sup>65</sup>. This means that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m"> isn’t necessarily a subset of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> as we would naturally define it. In this case, we need to inflate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> to be big enough to contain the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m">. So instead of taking <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20=%20C%5E1(%5COmega)">, we need to take <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20=%20C(%5COmega)"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20=%20L%5E2(%5COmega)">.</p>
<p>This has implications on the smoothness assumptions on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPhi(u;y)">, which will need to hold uniformly over <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m"> if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m%20%5Cnot%20%5Csubset%20B"> and on the set of functionals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G(u)"> that we use to measure convergence.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-bit-of-perspective">A bit of perspective</h3>
<p>The critical difference between the SPDE method and the subset-of-regressors approximation is that for the SPDE method, the stability constant <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_m%20=%20A"> is independent of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">. This will be important, as this constant pops up somewhere important when we are trying to quantify the error in the finite dimensional approximation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the SPDE method only works in three and fewer dimensions and while it allows for quite flexible covariance structures<sup>66</sup>, it is can only directly construct Gaussian processes with integer numbers of continuous derivatives. Is this a problem? The asymptotics say yes, but they only hold if we are working with the exact Gaussian process (or, I guess, if we let the dimension of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m"> hurtle off towards infinity as we get more and more data).</p>
<p>In practice, the Gaussian processes constructed via SPDE methods perform very well on real data<sup>67</sup>. I suspect part of this is that the stable set of basis functions are very good at approximating functions and the misspecification error plays off against the approximation error.</p>

<p>With all of this setup, we are finally ready to bound the error between the posterior we would get with the full Gaussian process prior and the posterior we would get using the finite dimensional Gaussian process prior.</p>
<p>We are going to deal with a simpler scenario than <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0641">the paper we are (sort of) following</a>, because in that situation, I was forced to deal with simultaneously approximating the likelihood and honestly who needs that trouble.</p>
<p>To remind ourselves, we have two priors: the full fat Gaussian process prior, the law of which we denote <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_0"> and the one we could possibly work with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_0%5Em">. These lead to two different posteriors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_y"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_y%5Em"> given by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cmu_y%7D%7Bd%5Cmu_0%7D(u)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D%5Cmathrm%7Be%7D%5E%7B-%5CPhi(u;y)%7D%20%5Cquad%20%5Ctext%7Band%7D%5Cquad%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cmu_y%5Em%7D%7Bd%5Cmu_0%5Em%7D(u)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ_m%7D%5Cmathrm%7Be%7D%5E%7B-%5CPhi(u;y)%7D%20,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z_m"> are normalising constants.</p>
<p>We assume that the Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is supported on some Banach space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V%20%5Csubseteq%20B"> and the approximating spaces <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m%20%5Csubset%20B">. This covers the case where the approximating functions are rougher than the true realisations of the Gaussian process we are approximating. With this notation, we have the restriction operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m"> that satisfies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7CR_mf%5C%7C_%7BV_m%7D%20%5Cleq%20A_m%20%5C%7Cf%5C%7C_V,%0A"> which is a slightly more targeted bound when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> is larger than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V">.</p>

<p>These restrictions are pretty light and are basically what are needed to make sure the posteriors exist. The first one say “don’t grow too fast” to the likelihood and is best explained while humming ABBA’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRr7qRb-7k4">Slipping Through My Fingers</a>. The second one makes sure the likelihood isn’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wk7C64kaP4">zero</a>.

<p>Under these conditions, we get the following theorem, which is a simplified version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0641">Theorem A2 here</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>I seriously doubt that the dependence on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_m"> is exponential, as it is in the proof, but I’m not going to try to track that down. That said, I’m also quite sure that the dependence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_m"> is not uniform in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> unless <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_m"> is constant.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that there’s nothing special about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> being real-valued. In general it can take values in any Banach space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E">. Just replace all those absolute values with norms.

Proof, if you’re interested

<p>We are interested in approximating <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ae_G%20=%20%5Cleft%7C%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_y%7D(G(u))%20-%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu%5Em_y%7D(G(u_m))%5Cright%7C.%0A"> We can expand this to get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ae_G%20%5Cleq%20&amp;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D%5Cleft%7C%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_0%7D%5Cleft(G(u)%5Cexp(-%5CPhi(u;y))%5Cright)%0A-%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_0%5Em%7D%5Cleft(G(u_m)%5Cexp(-%5CPhi(u_mm;y))%5Cright)%5Cright%7C%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;%5Cquad%20+%0A%5Cleft%7C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D%0A-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ_m%7D%5Cright%7C%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_0%5Em%7D%5Cleft(%7CG(u_m)%7C%5Cexp(-%5CPhi(u_m;y))%5Cright).%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20B_1%20+%20B_2.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>It follows from <a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masdr/BOOKCHAPTERS/stuart15c.pdf">Andrew Stuart’s work</a> that the normalising constants <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z_m"> can be bounded above and below independently of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">, so the above expression makes sense.</p>
<p>We will now attack <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B_2"> separately.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dealing-with-the-approximation-error">Dealing with the approximation error</h2>
<p>The theorem above shows that the worst-case error in posterior functionals caused by replacing a Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> with it’s approximation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m%20=%20R_m%20u"> is driven entirely by how well a general function from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V"> can be approximated by a function in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m">. This is not really a surprising result: if the approximation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m"> is unable to approximate the sample paths of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> it is very unlikely it will do a good job with <em>all</em> functionals.</p>
<p>Thankfully, approximation error is one of the better studied things in this world. Especially in the case where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V%20=%20B">.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s pretty easy to show<sup>69</sup> that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> derivatives, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_G%20%5Cleq%20Cm%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnu%7D%7Bd%7D%20+%20%5Cepsilon%7D"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%3E0">.</p>
<p>If you dive deep enough into the literature, you can get similar results for the type of approximation underneath the subset of regressors approximation.</p>
<p>For the SPDE approximation, it’s all a little bit more tricky as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m%20%5Cnot%20%5Csubset%20V">. But ultimately, you get that, for any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%20%3E0">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_G%20%5Cleq%20C%20h%5E%7B1-%5Cepsilon%7D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> is a measure of the mesh size<sup>70</sup>. This is roughly what you’d expect, there’s a loss of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon"> from the ordinary interpolation rate which may or may not be a result of me being a bit shit at maths.</p>
<p>The argument that gets us here is really cute so I’ll sketch it below. This is here for two reasons: firstly, because I think it’s cool and secondly because the paper is so compressed it’s hard to completely follow the argument, so I thought it would be nice to put on here. (It also took me a whole afternoon to decipher the proof in the paper, which is usually a sign that it could do with a bit of a re-write. How successfully I clarified it is something I will leave up to others to decide.)</p>

Finite element shit
</summary>
<p><strong>Setup. Gird yourselves!</strong></p>
<p>We are going to bound that error rate in a way that’s relevant for the finite element method. The natural choices for the function spaces are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V%20=%20H%5E%7B1-%5Cepsilon%7D(%5COmega)"> for some fixed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%20%3C%20%5Cepsilon%20%3C%201/2"> (close to zero is what we want). and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%20=%20L%5E2(%5COmega)">. (To be honest the domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega"> isn’t changing so I’m gonna forget it sometimes.)</p>
<p>Once again, we’re going to assume that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L"> is a second order uniformly elliptic PDE with no first-order terms (aka <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_1%20=%20%5Ccdots%20=%20b_d%20=%200">) and that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_0(s)%20%3E0"> on some subset of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5COmega">. We will use the symmetric, coercive bilinear form associated<sup>71</sup> with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">, which we can define, for any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u,v%20%5Cin%20H%5E1">, as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aa(u,%20v)%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20(A(s)%5Cnabla%20u(s))%5Ccdot%20%5Cnabla%20v(s)%5C,ds%20+%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20b_0(s)%20u(s)v(s)%5C,ds%0A"></p>
<p>Remembering that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m%20=%20LL_m%5E%5Cdagger">, we have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csup_%7Bv%20%5Cin%20V%7D%5Cfrac%7B%20%5Cleft%5C%7Cv%20-%20R_m%20v%5Cright%5C%7C_B%7D%7B%5C%7Cv%5C%7C_V%7D%20=%5Csup_%7Bf%5Cin%20LV%7D%5Cfrac%7B%20%5Cleft%5C%7CL%5E%7B-1%7Df%20-%20L_n%5E%7B%5Cdagger%7Df%5Cright%5C%7C_B%7D%7B%5C%7CL%5E%7B-1%7Df%5C%7C_V%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>The set of functions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%20%5Cin%20LV"> is the set of all functions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%20=%20Lv"> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20%5Cin%20V">. It can be shown that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?LV%20=%20H%5E%7B-1-%5Cepsilon%7D">, where the negative index indicates a dual Sobolev space (aka the space of continuous linear functionals on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H%5E%7B1+%20%5Cepsilon%7D">).</p>
<p>This means that we are looking at the difference between the solution to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Lu%20=%20f"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_m%20u_m%20=%20f_m">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_m"> is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E2">-orthogonal projection of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> onto <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m">, which is the space of piecewise linear functions on some<sup>72</sup> triangular mesh <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_m">.</p>
<p>We define the projection of the function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%20%5Cin%20H%5E%7B-1-%5Cepsilon%7D(%5COmega)"> onto <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m"> as the unique function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_m%20%5Cin%20V_m"> such that<sup>73</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_%5COmega%20f_n(s)%20v_n(s)%5C,ds%20=%20%5Cint%20f(s)%20v_n(s)%5C,ds,%20%5Cquad%20%5Cforall%20v_n%20%5Cin%20V_n.%0A"></p>
<p><strong>Now let’s do this!</strong></p>
<p>With all of this in place, we can actually do something. We want to bound <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B%5C%7Cu%20-%20u_m%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%7D%7D%7B%5C%7Cu%5C%7C_%7BH%5E%7B1+%5Cepsilon%7D%7D%7D,%0A"> where<sup>74</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a(u,%20%5Cphi)%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20f(s)%20%5Cphi(s)%5C,ds"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi%20%5Cin%20H%5E%7B1+%5Cepsilon%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a(u_m,%20%5Cphi_m)%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20f(s)%20%5Cphi_m(s)%5C,ds"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi_m%20%5Cin%20V_m%20%5Csubset%20H%5E%7B1+%5Cepsilon%7D">.</p>
<p>The key observation is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_%5COmega%20f(s)%20%5Cphi_m(s)%5C,ds%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20f_m(s)%20%5Cphi_m(s)%5C,ds,%0A"> which suggests that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m(s)"> is an approximation to <em>two different problems</em>!</p>
<p>Let’s write this second problem down! We want to find <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z%5E%7B(m)%7D"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aa(%7Bz%7D%5E%7B(m)%7D,%20%5Cphi)%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20f_n(s)%20%5Cphi(s)%5C,ds%20%5Cquad%20%5Cforall%20%5Cphi%20%5Cin%20H%5E%7B1%7D%20,%0A"> where the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> superscript indicates that it depends on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> through it’s right hand side. The projection <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_n%20%5Cin%20L%5E2">, which means that we are in the realm of usual PDEs and (assuming some regularity) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z%5E%7B(m)%7D%20%5Cin%20H%5E2">.</p>
<p>Hence, we can write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7Cu%20-%20u_m%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%7D%5Cleq%20%5C%7Cu%20-%20z%5E%7B(m)%7D%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%7D%20+%20%5C%7Cz%5E%7B(m)%7D%20-%20u_m%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>We can bound the second term almost immediately from standard finite element theory, which says that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5C%7Cz%5E%7B(m)%7D%20-%20u_m%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%7D%20%5Cleq%20Ch%5E2%20%5C%7Cf_n%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>To estimate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Cf_m%5C%7C"> we use the inverse estimates of <a href="https://etna.math.kent.edu/vol.12.2001/pp134-148.dir/pp134-148.pdf">Ben Belgacem and Brenner</a> to show that, for any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%5Cin%20L%5E2(%5COmega)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cint_%5COmega%20f_m(s)%20v(s)%20%5C,ds%20=%20%5Cint_%5COmega%20f(s)v_m(s)%20%20%5C,ds%5Cleq%5C%7Cf%5C%7C_%7BH%5E%7B-1-%5Cepsilon%7D%7D%5C%7Cv_m%5C%7C_%7BH%5E%7B1+%5Cepsilon%7D%7D%20%5Cleq%20Ch%5E%7B-1-%5Cepsilon%7D%20%5C%7Cf%5C%7C_%7BH%5E%7B-1-%5Cepsilon%7D%7D%20%5C%7Cv%5C%7C_%7BL%5E2%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_m"> is the orthogonal projection of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> onto <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m">.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>So. That was quite a lot. I enjoyed it, but I’m weird like that. This has mostly been me trying to remember what I did in 2015. Why? Because I felt like it.</p>
<p>I also think that there’s some value in this way of thinking about Gaussian processes and it’s nice to show off some ways to use all of that weird shit in <a href="https://dansblog.netlify.app/posts/2021-11-03-yes-but-what-is-a-gaussian-process-or-once-twice-three-times-a-definition-or-a-descent-into-madness/">the last post</a>.</p>
<p>All of these words can be boiled down to this take away:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If your finite dimensional GP <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m"> is linked to a GP <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> by some (potentially non-linear relationship) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_m=%20R_m%20u">, then the posterior error will be controlled by how well you can approximate a function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> that <em>could</em> be a realisation of the GP by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m%20v">.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very intuitive result if you are already thinking of GP approximation as approximating a random function. But a lot of the literature takes a view that we are approximating a covariance matrix or a multivariate normal. This might be enough to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator, but it’s insufficient for approximating a posterior<sup>77</sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, because most of the constants in the bounds don’t depend too heavily on the specific finite dimensional approximation (except through <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_m">), we can roughly say that if we have two methods for approximating a GP, the one that does a better job at approximating functions will be the better choice.</p>
<p>As long as it was, this isn’t a complete discussion of the problem. We have not considered hyper-parameters! This is a little bit tricky because if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_0"> depends on parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_m"> will also depend on parameters (and for subset of regressors, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_m"> also depends on the parameters).</p>
<p>In theory, we could use this to bound the error in the posterior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)">. To see how we would do that, let’s consider the case where we have Gaussian observations.</p>
<p>Then we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0Ap(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)%20&amp;%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cexp(-%5CPhi(u;y))%7D%7Bp(y)%7D%20%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cmu_y%7D%7Bd%5Cmu_0%7D%5Cright%5D%5E%7B-1%7D%20p(%5Ctheta)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cfrac%7BZ(%5Ctheta)%20p(%5Ctheta)%7D%7B%5Cint_%5CTheta%20Z(%5Ctheta)p(%5Ctheta)%5C,d%5Ctheta%7D,%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Z(%5Ctheta)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%5Cmu_0%7D%5Cleft(e%5E%7B-%5CPhi(u;y)%7D%5Cright)">.</p>
<p>We could undoubtedly bound the error in this using similar techniques to the ones we’ve already covered (in fact, we’ve already got a bound on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7CZ%20-%20Z_m%7C">). And then it would just be a matter of piecing it all together.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Naively: a condescending way to say “the way you were told to use them”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Is it better to have a large amount of crappy data or a small amount of decent data? Depends on if you’re trying to impress people by being right or by being flashy.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Who doesn’t love a good shape. Or my personal favourite: a point pattern.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Or, hell, this is our information about how to query the Gaussian process to get the information we need for this observation. Because, again, this does not have to be as simple as evaluating the function at a point!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>This could be time, space, space-time, covariate space, a function space, a lattice, a graph, an orthogonal frame, a manifold, a perversion, whatever. It doesn’t matter. It’s all just Gaussian processes. Don’t let people try to tell you this shit is fancy.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>This could be covariate information, group information, hierarchy information, causal information, survey information, or really anything else you want it to be. Take a deep breath. Locate your inner peace. Add whatever you need to the model to make it go boop.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>I will never use this assumption. Think of it like the probability space at the top of a annals of stats paper.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>So the thing is that this is here because it was funny to me when I wrote it, but real talk: just being like “it’s iid” is some real optimism (optimism, like hope, has no place in statistics.) and pretending that this is a light or inconsequential assumption is putting some bad energy out into the world. But that said, I was once a bit drunk at a bar with a subjective Bayesian (if you want to pick your drinking Bayesian, that’s not a bad choice. They’re all from The North) and he was screaming at me for thinking about what would happen if I had more data, and I was asking him quietly and politely how the data could possibly inform models as complex as he seemed to be proposing. And he said to me: what you do is you look for structures within your data that are exchangeable in some sense (probably after conditioning) and you use those as weak replicates. And, of course, I knew that but I’d never thought about it that way. Modelling, eh. Do it properly.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>These (and the associated parenthetical girls) were supposed to be nested footnotes but Markdown is homophobic and doesn’t allow them. I am being oppressed.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>It’s an interesting area, but the tooling isn’t there for people who don’t want to devote a year of their lives to this to experiment.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This is what matrix nerds say when they mean “I love you”. Or when they mean that it’s all derived from the structure of a matrix rather than from some structural principles stolen from the underlying problem. The matrix people are complicated.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>The reason for this is that, while there are clever methods for getting determinants of H-matrices, they don’t actually scale all that well. So Geoga, Anitescu, and Stein paper use a Hutchinson estimator of the log-determinant. This has ok relative accuracy, but unfortunately, we need it to have excellent absolute accuracy to use it in a Bayesian procedure (believe me, I have tried). On the other hand, the Hutchinson estimator of the <em>gradient</em> of the log-determinant is pretty stable and gives a really nice approximate gradient. This is why MLE type methods for learning the hyper-parameters of a GP can be made scalable with H-matrix techniques.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Otherwise, why bother. Just sub-sample and get on the beers. Or the bears. Or both. Whatever floats your boat.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and probably other parameters in the model↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Dual spaces, y’all. This vector was inevitable because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">-dimensional row vectors are the dual space of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em">, while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_i%20%5Crightarrow%20u(s_i)"> is in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%5E*">.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>This is not surprising if you’re familiar with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06195">sketching-type bounds that Yang, Pilanci and Wainwright did a while back</a> (or, for that matter, with any non-asymptotic bounds involving the the complexity of the RKHS). Isn’t maths fun.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Hölder↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Think “infinitely differentiable but more so”.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>An analytic function is one that you know will walk straight home from the pub, whereas a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">-differentiable function might just go around the corner, hop on grindr, and get in a uber. Like he’s not going to go to the other side of the city, but he might pop over to a nearby suburb. A generalised function texts you a photo of a doorway covered by a bin bag with a conveniently placed hole at 2am with no accompanying message other than an address↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>I mean, I cannot be sure, but I’m pretty sure.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>Again, not strictly necessary but it removes a tranche of really annoying technicalities and isn’t an enormous restriction in practice.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>The result is that there is no non-trivial translation invariant measure on a separable Banach space (aka there is no analogue of the Lebesgue measure). You can prove this by using separability to make a disjoint cover of equally sized balls, realise that they would all have to have the same measure, and then say “Fuck. I’ve got too many balls”.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>Borel. Because we have assumed <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> is separable, the cylindrical <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra is identical to the Borel <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_0"> is a Radon measure. Party.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>See <a href="http://stuart.caltech.edu/publications/pdf/stuart15c.pdf">Andrew Stuart’s long article on formulating Bayesian problems in this context</a> and <a href="http://stuart.caltech.edu/publications/pdf/stuart89.pdf">Masoumeh Dashti and Andrew Stuart’s paper paper on (simple) finite dimensional approximations</a>.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn27"><p>This covers GP models, GAMs, lots of spatial models, and a bunch of other stuff.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn31"><p>In the interest of accuracy, Janine and I were giving back to back talks at a conference that we decided for some reason to give as a joint talk and I remember her getting more and more agitated as I was sitting in the back row of the conference desperately trying to contort the innards of INLA to the form I needed to make the damn thing work. It worked and we had results to present. We also used the <a href="https://r-inla.org/">INLA software</a> in any number of ways it had not been used before that conference. The talk was pretty well received and I was very relieved. It was also my first real data analysis and I didn’t know to do things like “look at the data” to check assumptions, so it was a bit of a clusterfuck and again Janine was very patient. I was a <em>very</em> useless 25 year old and a truly shit statistician. But we get better if we practice and now I’m a perfectly ok statistician.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>Janine and I, with Finn Lindgren, Sigrunn Sørbye and Håvard Rue, who were all heavily involved throughout but I’m sure I’ve already exhausted people’s patience.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>IIRC, Sigrunn’s university has one of those stupid lists where venue matters more than quality. Australia is also obsessed with this. It’s dumb.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>In hindsight, the reviewer was asking for a simulation study, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask for but at the time I couldn’t work out how to do that because, in my naive numerical analyst ways, I thought we would need to compare our answer to a ground truth and I didn’t know how to do that. Now I know that the statistician way is to compute the same thing two different ways on exactly one problem that’s chosen pretty carefully and saying “it looks similar”.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn39"><p>The thing about inverse problems is that they assume <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPhi(u;y)"> is the solution of some PDE or integral equation, so they don’t make any convenient simplifying assumptions that make their results inapplicable to LGCPs!↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn44"><p>On <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E2">, which is a Hilbert space so the basis really is countable.

<li id="fn54"><p>What is white noise? It is emphatically not a stochastic process that has the delta function as it’s covariance function. That thing is just ugly.

<p>I guess I’m going to talk about Gaussian processes now. This wasn’t the plan but who really expected a) there to be a plan or b) me to stick to the plan. I feel like writing about Gaussian processes and so I shall! It will be grand.</p>
<section id="what-is-a-gaussian-process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-gaussian-process">What is a Gaussian process?</h2>
<p>Well I could tell you that a Gaussian process is defined by its joint distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Au%20%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu,%20%5CSigma),%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_i%20=%20u(s_i)">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_i%20=%20%5Cmu(s_i)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma_%7Bij%7D%20=%20c(s_i,%20s_j)"> for some positive definite covariance (or kernel) function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c(%5Ccdot,%20%5Ccdot)">.</p>
<p>But that would be about as useful as presenting you with a dog that can bark “she’s a grand old flag”: perhaps good enough for a novelty hit, but there’s just no longevity in it.</p>
<p>To understand a Gaussian process you need to <em>feel it</em> deep down within you where the fear and the detailed mathematical concepts live.</p>
<p>So let’s try again.</p>
</section>
<section id="were-gonna-have-a-you-know-what.-im-not-gonna-do-that.-but-i-am-going-to-define-this-stuff-three-times.-once-for-mum-once-for-dad-and-once-for-the-country." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="were-gonna-have-a-you-know-what.-im-not-gonna-do-that.-but-i-am-going-to-define-this-stuff-three-times.-once-for-mum-once-for-dad-and-once-for-the-country.">We’re gonna have a … you know what. I’m not gonna do that. But I am going to define this stuff three times. Once for mum, once for dad, and once for the country.</h2>
<p>You’ve got to wonder why anyone would introduce something three ways. There are some reasons. The first is, of course, that each definition gives you a different insight into different aspects of Gaussian processes (the operational, the boundless generality, the functional). And the second is because I’ve had to use all three of these ideas (and several more) over the years in order to understand how Gaussian processes work.</p>
<p>I learnt about GPs from several sources (listed not in order):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-finn-lindgren">A Swede</a><sup>1</sup> (so I will rant about random fields in the footnotes eventually);</p></li>
<li><p>A book<sup>2</sup> that was introducing GPs in a very general way because they needed the concept in outrageous generality to answer questions about the distribution of the maximum of a Gaussian process;</p></li>
<li><p>A book<sup>3</sup> written by a Russian who’s really only into measure theory and doesn’t believe anything is real if it isn’t at least happening on a Frechet space;</p></li>
<li><p>And a book<sup>4</sup> by a different Russian who’s really only into generalised Markov properties and needed to work with Gaussian processes that are defined over <em>functions</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the most relevant is probably the first one. I was primarily taught this stuff by <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-finn-lindgren">Finn Lindgren</a>, who had the misfortune of having the office next to mine when we worked together in Trondheim a very long time ago. (We both had a lot more hair then.)</p>
<p>One of the things that I learnt from him is that Gaussian processes can appear in all kinds of contexts, which means you need to understand them <em>as a model for an unknown function</em> rather than as a tool to be used in a specific context (like for Gaussian process regression or Gaussian process classification).</p>
<p>It’s some effort to really get a good grip on the whole “Gaussian processes as a model for an unknown function” thing but once you relax into it<sup>5</sup>, it stops being alarming to see models where you are observing things that aren’t just <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s_k)">. It is not alarming when you are observing integrals of the GP over regions, or derivatives. And you (or your methods) don’t fall apart when presented with complex non-linear functions on the GP (as happens if you look at<br>
Bayesian inverse problems literature<sup>6</sup>).</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-gaussian-process-version-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-gaussian-process-version-1">What is a Gaussian process? (Version 1)</h2>
<p>I’m going to start with the most common definition of a Gaussian process<sup>7</sup>. This is the definition that was alluded to in the first section and it’s also the definition operationalised in books like Rasmussen and Williams’<sup>8</sup>, which is a bread and butter reference for most machine learners interested in GPs, use.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty straightforward: I need to define a stochastic model for an unknown function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> and I want it to be, in some sense, Gaussian. So how do I go about doing this?</p>
<p>Firstly, I probably don’t care too much about the function as an abstract object. For example, if I’m using the Gaussian process to model something like temperature, I am only going to observe it at a fairly small number of places (even though I could choose any set of places I want). This means that for some <em>arbitrary</em> set set of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> locations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_1,%20s_2,%20%5Cldots,%20s_K">, I am most interested<sup>9</sup> in understanding the <em>joint distribution</em><sup>10</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(u(s_1),%20%5Cdots,%20u(s_K))%5ET.%0A"></p>
<p>So how would we model the joint distribution? If we want the model to be tractable, we probably want a nice distribution. This is where the <em>Gaussian</em> part comes in. The Gaussian distribution is an extremely tractable<sup>11</sup> distribution in medium-to-high dimensions. So the choice to model our joint distribution (which could be any size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K">) as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(u(s_1),%20%5Cdots,%20u(s_K))%5ET%20%5Csim%20N%5Cleft(%5Cmu_%7Bs_1,%20%5Cldots,%20s_K%7D,%20%5CSigma_%7Bs_1,%20%5Cldots,%20s_K%7D%5Cright),%0A"> makes sense from a purely mercenary position<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>So how do we choose the mean and the covariance function? We will see that the mean can be selected as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B%5Cmu_%7Bs_1,%20%5Cldots,%20s_K%7D%5D_%7Bk%7D%20=%20%5Cmu(s_k)"> for pretty much any function<sup>13</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu(%5Ccdot)">, but, when we come to write <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5B%5CSigma_%7Bs_1,%20%5Cldots,%20s_K%7D%5D_%7Bij%7D%20=%20c(s_i,%20s_j),%0A"> there will be some very strong restrictions on the <em>covariance function</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c(%5Ccdot,%20%5Ccdot)">.</p>
<p>So where do these restrictions come from?</p>
<section id="oh-those-gay-russians" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oh-those-gay-russians">Oh those (gay) Russians!</h3>
<p>As with all things in probability, all the good shit comes from the Soviets. Kolmogorov<sup>14</sup> was a leading light in the Soviet push to formalise probability and one of his many many many contributions is something called the <em>Kolmogorov extension theorem</em>, which gives the exact conditions under which we can go from declaring that the distributions of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u(s_1),%20%5Cldots,%20u(s_K))%5ET"> (these are called finite dimensional distributions) are Gaussian to describing a legitimate random function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)">.</p>
<p>There are essentially two conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The order of the observations doesn’t matter in a material way. In our case changing the order just permutes the rows and columns of the mean vector and covariance matrix, which is perfectly ok.</li>
<li>There is a consistent way to map between the distributions of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u(s_1),%20%5Cldots,%20u(s_K),%20u(s_%7BK+1%7D))%5ET"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u(s_1),%20%5Cldots,%20u(s_K))%5ET">. This is the condition that puts a strong restriction on the covariance function.</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, we need to make sure that we have a consistent way to add rows and columns to our covariance matrix while ensuring that stays positive definite (that is, while all of the eigenvalues stay non-negative, which is the condition required for a multivariate normal distribution<sup>15</sup>). The condition—which is really gross—is that for every positive integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> and every set of points <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_1,%20%5Cldots,%20s_k">, and for every <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1,%20%5Cldots,%20a_K"> not all equal to zero, we require that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5EK%20%5Csum_%7Bj%20=%201%7D%5EK%20a_ia_j%20c(s_i,%20s_j)%20%5Cgeq%200.%0A"></p>
<p>This condition is obviously very difficult to check. This is why people typically choose their covariance function from a very short list<sup>16</sup> that is typically found in a book on Gaussian processes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-kolmogorov-said-a-little-bit-more">But Kolmogorov said a little bit more</h2>
<p>There’s a weird thing in grad school in North America where they insist on teaching measure theoretic probability theory and then never ever ever ever ever using any of the subtleties. But Gaussian processes (and, in general, stochastic processes on uncountable index spaces) are a great example of when you need these details.</p>
<p>Why? Because unlike discrete probability (where the set of events that we can compute the probability of is obvious) or even continuous random variables (where the events that we can’t compute the probability of are so weird we can truly just ignore them unless we are doing something truly exotic), for Gaussian processes,<sup>17</sup> the set of allowable events is considerably smaller than the set of all things you might want probabilities of.</p>
<p>The gist of it is that we have built up a random function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> from a bunch of finite random vectors. This means that we can only assign probabilities to events that can be built up from events on finite random vectors. The resulting set of events (or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra to use the adult term) is called the cylindrical<sup>18</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra and can be roughly<sup>19</sup> thought of as the set of all events that can be evaluated by evaluating <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)"> at most a countable number of times.</p>
</section>
<section id="things-that-arent-measurable" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="things-that-arent-measurable">Things that aren’t measurable</h2>
<p>This will potentially become a problem if, for instance, you are working with a Gaussian process in a model that uses a Gaussian process in a weird way. When this happens, it is <em>not</em> guaranteed that, for instance, your likelihood is a measurable function, which would mean that you can’t normalise your probability distribution! (I mean, don’t worry. Unless you’re doing something fairly wild it will be, but it has come up especially in the inverse problems literature!)</p>
<p>This limited set of measurable events even seems to preclude well studied “events” like “<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is continuous” or “<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is twice continuously differentiable” or “<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> has a finite supremum”. All things that we a) want to know about a Gaussian process and b) things people frequently say about Gaussian processes. It is common for people to say that “Brownian motion is continuous” and similar things.</p>
<p>As with all of mathematics, there are a lot of work arounds that we can use. For those three statements in particular, there is some really elegant mathematical work (due, again, to Kolmogorov and extended greatly by others). The idea is that we can build another function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u(s)"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u(s)%20=%20%5Ctilde%20u(s))%20=%201"> for <em>all</em><sup>20</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u(s)"> is continuous (or differentiable or bounded).</p>
<p>In the language of stochastic processes, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u(s)"> is called a <em>version</em> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> and the more correct, temperate language (aka the one least likely to find in the literature) is that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> has a continuous/differentiable/bounded <em>version</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in seeing how a differentiable version of a Gaussian process is constructed, you basically have to dick around with dyads for a while. Martin Hairer’s lecture notes<sup>21</sup> is a nice clear example.</p>
<section id="where-are-the-limitations-of-this-definition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-are-the-limitations-of-this-definition">Where are the limitations of this definition?</h3>
<p>There are a few. These are, of course, in the eye of the beer holder. The definition is workable in a lot of situations and, with some explanation can be broadened out a bit more. It’s less of a great definition when you’re trying to manipulate Gaussian processes as mathematical objects, but that’s what the next one is for.</p>
<p>The first limitation is maybe not so much a limit of the definition as a bit of work you have to do to make it applicable. And that is: what happens if I am observing (or my likelihood depends on) averages like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cleft(%5Cint_S%20%5Cell_1(s)%20u(s)%5C,ds,%20%5Cldots,%20%5Cint_S%20%5Cell_K(s)%20u(s)%5C,ds%5Cright)%5ET%0A"> instead of simple point evaluations<sup>22</sup>.</p>
<p>This might seem like a massively different problem, until we remember that integrals are just sums dressed up for Halloween, so we can approximate the integrals arbitrarily well by sums<sup>23</sup>. In fact, if we squint<sup>24</sup> a bit, we can see that the above vector will also be multivariate Gaussian with mean vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5B%5Cmu%5D_k%20=%20%5Cint_S%20%5Cell_k(s)%20%5Cmu(s)%5C,ds%0A"> and covariance matrix with entries <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5B%5CSigma%5D_%7Bij%7D%20=%20%5Cint_%7BS%20%5Ctimes%20S%7D%20%5Cell_i(s)%20%5Cell_j(s')c(s,%20s')%5C,dsds'.%0A"> Similar formulas hold for derivative observations.</p>
<p>Probably the bigger limitation is that in this way of seeing things, your view is tied very tightly to the covariance function. While it is a natural object for defining Gaussian processes, it is fucking inconvenient if you want to understand things like how well approximate Gaussian processes work.</p>
<p>And let’s face it, a big chunk of Gaussian processes we see in practice are approximate because the computational burden on large data sets is too big to do anything but approximate.</p>
<p>(Fun fact, when I was much much younger I wrote a paper that was a better title than a paper<sup>25</sup> called<sup>26</sup> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.1137"><em>In order to make spatial statistics computationally feasible, we need to abandon the covariance function.</em></a> I copped a lot of shit for it at the time [partly because the title was better than the paper, but partly because some people are dicks], but I think the subsequent 10 years largely proved me (or at least my title) right<sup>27</sup>.)</p>
<p>The focus on the covariance function also hides the strong similarity between Gaussian process literature and the smoothing splines literature starting from Grace Wahba in the 1970s. It’s not that nobody notices this, but it’s <em>work</em> to get there!</p>
<p>In a similar way, it hides the fundamental role the <em>reproducing kernel Hilbert space</em> (or Cameron-Martin space) is doing and the ways that Gaussian process regression is (and is not) like kernel smoothing in RKHSs. This, again, isn’t a <em>secret</em> per se—you can find this information if you want it—but it’s confusing to people and the lack of clarity leads to people missing useful connections (or sometimes leads to them drawing mistaken parallels).</p>
<p>How many times have you seen someone say that realisations of a Gaussian process are in the RKHS associated with the covariance function? They are not. In fact, every realisation of a Gaussian process is rougher than any function in the RKHS (with probability 1)! Unfortunately, this means that your reason for choosing the kernel in a RKHS regression and for choosing the covariance function in a Gaussian process prior need to be subtly different. Or, to put it differently, a penalty is not a log-prior and interpreting the maximum a penalised likelihood is, in high dimensions, a very distant activity from interpreting a posterior distribution (even when the penalty is the log of the prior).</p>

<p>Ok. Let’s do this again. This definition lives in a considerably more mathematical space and while I’m gonna try to explain the key terms, I will fail. But hey. Who doesn’t like googling weird terms?</p>
<p>A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s%20%5Cin%20S"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> is some set of things that isn’t too topologically disastrous<sup>28</sup>.</p>
<p>But what makes it Gaussian? Here’s the general definition.</p>

<p>A stochastic process/random field is <em>Gaussian</em> if and only if every continuous <em>linear functional</em> has a univariate Gaussian distribution.</p>

<p>Point evaluation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s_j)"> (aka evaluating the function at a point) is a linear functional (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(u%20+%20v)(s)_j%20=%20u(s_j)%20+%20v(s_j)">). As is a definite integral over a set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cint_A%20u(s)%5C,ds">.</p>
<p>It’s a fun little exercise to convince yourself that this all implies that for any collection <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_1(%5Ccdot),%20%5Cldots,%20%5Cell_J(%5Ccdot)"> of continuous linear functionals, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> is a Gaussian process means that the vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(%5Cell_1(u),%20%5Cldots%20%5Cell_J(u))%5ET%0A"> is multivariate Gaussian.</p>

<p>If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> lives in a Banach space<sup>30</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">, then the set of all continuous/bounded linear functionals on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> is called the dual space and is denoted <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%5E*">. <!-- A lot of time, it becomes inconvenient to write $\ell(u)$ and we write $ --> <!-- \langle u, \ell \rangle. --> <!-- $ This is called a _duality pairing_ and the notation is reminiscent of an inner  --> <!-- product because of an inner product with one single striking difference: for an  --> <!-- inner product the thing on the left has the same _type_^[is in the same space] as --> <!-- the thing on the right, whereas for a duality pairing the thing on the left is always --> <!-- in $B$ while the thing on the right is always in $B^*$, which is _not_ the same as $B$  --> <!-- in general^[If $B$ has an inner product (aka it's a Hilbert space) the two spaces are   --> <!-- automatically "the same" and the duality pairing is "the same" as the inner product).]. --></p>

<p>In this context, the most important thing about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%5E*"> is it does double duty: it is both a space of linear functionals <em>and</em> a space that can be identified with random variables.</p>
<p><em>How the fuck do you do that?</em></p>
<p>Well, the trick is to remember the definition! If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Cin%20B%5E*">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell(u)"> is a Gaussian. Similarly, if we have two functionals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell,%20%5Cell'%20%5Cin%20B%5E*"> we consider the covariance of their associated random variables <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_u(%5Cell,%20%5Cell')%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(%5Cell(u)%5Cell'(u)).%0A"></p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_u(%5Cell,%20%5Cell')"> is a symmetric, positive definite bilinear form (aka good candidate for an inner product)!</p>
<p>We can use this to add more functions to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%5E*">, particularly for any sequence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_n%20%5Cin%20B%5E*"> that is Cauchy with respect to the norm <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7C%5Cell%5C%7C_%7BR_u%7D%20=%20%5Csqrt%7BC_u(%5Cell,%20%5Cell)%7D"> we append the limit to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%5E*"> to complete the space. Once we take equivalence classes, we end up with a Hilbert space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_u"> that, very unfortunately, probabilists have a tendency to call the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">.</p>
<p>Why is this unfortunate? Well primarily because it’s not the exact same space that machine learners call the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is, to put it mildly, confusing. But we can build the machine learner’s RKHS (known to probabilists as the Cameron-Martin space).</p>
<p><em>Why are you even telling me this? Is this a digression?</em></p>
<p>Honestly. Yes. But regardless the space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_u"> is quite useful to understand what’s going on. To start off, let’s do one example that shows just how different a Gaussian process is from a multivariate normal random vector. We will show that if we multiply a GP by a constant, we completely change its support<sup>31</sup>! Many a computational and inferential ship have come to grief on these sharp rocks.</p>
<p>To do this, though, we need<sup>32</sup> to make an assumption on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">: We assume that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> is separable<sup>33</sup>. This isn’t an vacuous assumption, but in a lot of cases of practical interest, this is basically the same thing as assuming the set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> is a nice bounded domain or a friendly compact manifold (and not something like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed">)<sup>34</sup>.</p>
<p>So. How do we use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_u"> to show that Gaussian processes are evil? Well we begin by noting that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_u"> is a separable<sup>35</sup> Hilbert space it contains an orthonormal basis <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_n">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=1,%20%5Cldots,%20%5Cinfty"> (that is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Ce_n%5C%7C_%7BR_u%7D%20=%201"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clangle%20e_n,%20e_m%5Crangle_%7BR_u%7D%20=%200"> if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%5Cneq%20m">). We can use this basis to show some really really weird stuff about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)">.</p>
<p>In particular, consider another Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v(s)%20=%20c%20u(s)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> is a non-zero constant. For this process we can build <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_v"> in an analogous way. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_n"> are still orthogonal in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_v"> but now <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7Ce_n%5C%7C_%7BR_v%7D%20=%20c%5E2">.</p>
<p>Now consider the functional <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_K(%5Ccdot)%20=%20K%5E%7B-1%7D%5Csum_%7Bk%20=%201%7D%5EKe_i(%5Ccdot)%5E2">. We are going to use this function to break stuff! To do this, we are going to define two disjoint sets of functions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_1%20=%20%5C%7Bu:%20%5Clim_%7BK%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty%7D%20X_K(u)%20=%201%5C%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_2%20=%20%5C%7Bu:%20%5Clim_%7BK%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty%7D%20X_K(u)%20=%20c%5E2%5C%7D">. Clearly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_2"> are disjoint if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7Cc%7C%5Cneq%201">.</p>
<p>Because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_n(%5Ccdot)"> are orthonormal in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_u">, it follows that that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u_n%20=%20e_n(u)%20%5Csim%20N(0,1)"> are iid. Similarly, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_n%20=%20e_n(v)%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20c%5E2)"> are also independent. Hence it follows from the properties of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cchi%5E2"> random variables (aka the mean plus the strong law of large numbers) that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_K(u)%20%5Crightarrow%201"> and hence <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A_1)%20=%201">. On the other hand, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_K(v)%20%5Crightarrow%20c%5E2">, so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(v%20%5Cin%20A_2)%20=%201">. As <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_2"> are disjoint, this means that unless <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7Cc%7C=1">, the processes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> are mutually singular (aka they have no overlapping support).</p>
<p>What does this mean? This means the distributions of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> (which remember is just <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> multiplied by a constant) are as different from each other as a normal distribution truncated to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(-%5Cinfty,%201)"> and another normal distribution truncated to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(1,%20%5Cinfty)">! Or, more realistically<sup>36</sup>, as disjoint as a distribution over <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(2%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%20-%201)">.</p>
<p>This is an example of the most annoying phenomena in Gaussian processes<sup>37</sup>: the slightest change in a Gaussian process can lead to a mutually singular process. In fact, this is not a particularly strange example. It can be shown that Gaussian processes over uncountable index spaces are either absolutely continuous or mutually singular. There is no half-arsing it!</p>
<p>This has <em>a lot</em> of implications when it comes to computing<sup>38</sup>, setting priors on the parameters that control the properties of the covariance function<sup>39</sup>, and just generally inference<sup>40</sup>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="yes-but-wheres-our-reproducing-kernel-hilbert-space">Yes but where’s our reproducing kernel Hilbert space</h3>
<p>We just saw that if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is a Gaussian process than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20u"> will be a singular GP if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7Cc%7C%20%5Cneq%201">. What happens if we add things? Well, a result known as the Cameron-Martin theorem says that, for a deterministic <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h(s)%20%5Cin%20B">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)%20+%20h(s)"> is absolutely continuous wrt <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> if and only if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h(s)"> is in the Cameron-Martin space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_u"> (<em>this is the one that machine learners call the RKHS</em>!).</p>
<p><em>But how do we find this mythical space? I find this quite stressful!</em></p>
<p>Like, honey I do not know. But when a probabilist is in distress, we can calm them by screaming <em>characteristic function</em> at the top of our lungs right into their ear. Try it. It definitely works. You won’t be arrested.</p>
<p>So let’s do that. The characteristic function of a univariate random variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphi_X(t)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft(e%5E%7BitX%7D%5Cright),%0A"> which doesn’t <em>seem</em> like it’s going to be an amazingly useful thing, but it actually is. It’s how you prove the central limit theorem<sup>41</sup>, and a few other shiny things.</p>
<p>When we are dealing with more complex random things, like random vectors and Gaussian processes, we can use characteristic functions, but we need to extend beyond the fact that they’re currently only defined for univariate random variables. Conveniently, we have some lying around. In particular, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Cin%20B%5E*">, we have the associated random variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell(u)"> and we can compute its characteristic function<sup>42</sup>, which leads to the definition of a characteristic function of a stochastic process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphi_u(%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(e%5E%7Bi%5Cell(u)%7D),%20%5Cquad%20%5Cell%20%5Cin%20B%5E*.%0A"></p>
<p>Now this <em>feels</em> quite different. It’s no longer a function of some real number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> but is instead a function of a linear functional <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell">, which feels weird but isn’t.</p>
<p>Characteristic functions are immensely useful because if two Gaussian processes have same characteristic function they have the same distribution<sup>43</sup>.</p>
<p>Because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> is a Gaussian process, we can compute its characteristic function! We know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell(u)"> is Gaussian so we can look up its characteristic function on Wikipedia and get that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(e%5E%7Bi%5Cell(u)%7D)%20=%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5B%7Bi%20%5Cmu(%5Cell)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csigma%5E2(%5Cell)%7D%7B2%7D%7D%5Cright%5D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu(%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(%5Cell(u))"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2(%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(%5Cell(u)%20-%20%5Cmu(%5Cell))%5E2">.</p>
<p>We know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmu(%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(%5Cell(u))%0A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csigma%5E2(%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B(%5Cell(u)%20-%20%5Cmu(%5Cell)%5E2%5Cright%5D,%0A"> the latter of which can be extended naturally to the aforementioned positive definite quadratic form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_u(%5Cell,%20%5Cell')%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B(%5Cell(u)%20-%20%5Cmu(%5Cell)(%5Cell'(u)%20-%20%5Cmu(%5Cell'))%5Cright%5D,%20%5Cquad%20%5Cell,%20%5Cell'%20%5Cin%20B%5E*.%0A"></p>
<p>This leads to the exact form of the characteristic function and to this theorem, which is true.</p>

<p><em>So Alf is back. In pog form.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In this case, we can define the covariance operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_u:%20B%5E*%20%5Crightarrow%20B"> as<sup>44</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(C_u%20%5Cell)%20(%5Cell')%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B(%5Cell(u)%20-%20%5Cmu(%5Cell)(%5Cell'(u)%20-%20%5Cmu(%5Cell'))%5Cright%5D.%0A"> The definition is cleaner when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu(%5Cell)%20=%200"> (which is why people tend to assume that when writing this shit down<sup>45</sup>), in which case we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_u%5Cell%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(u%5Cell(u))%0A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_u(%5Cell,%20%5Cell')%20=%20%5Cell'(C_u%5Cell)%0A"></p>
<p><em>Great gowns, beautiful gowns.</em></p>
<p>Wow. Shady.</p>
<p>Anyway, the whole reason to introduce this is the following:</p>
<div id="thm-cameron-martin" class="theorem">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Theorem 2 </strong></span>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20=%20x%20+%20h">. Then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphi_v(%5Cell)%20=%20e%5E%7Bi%5Cell(h)%7D%5Cphi_u(%5Cell).%0A"></p>
</div>
<p>This does not not help us answer the question of whether or not <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v"> has the same support as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">. To do this, we construct a variable that <em>is</em> absolutely continuous with respect to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> (we guarantee this because we specify its density<sup>46</sup> wrt <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">).</p>
<p>To this end, take some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%20%5Cin%20R_u"> and define a stochastic process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> with density wrt<sup>47</sup> u <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Crho(u)%20=%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5BiC_u(g,%20u)%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DC_u(g,g)%5Cright%5D.%0A"></p>
<p>From this, we can compute<sup>48</sup> the characteristic function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Cphi_w(%5Cell)%20&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_w%5Cleft(e%5E%7Bi%5Cell(w)%7D%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_u%5Cleft(%5Crho(u)%20e%5E%7Bi%5Cell(u)%7D%5Cright)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cexp%5Cleft%5BiC_u(g,%5Cell)%20+%20i%20%5Cmu(%5Cell)%20%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DC_u(%5Cell,%20%5Cell)%5Cright%5D%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p>So we are fine if we can find some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%20%5Cin%20B"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_u(g,%20%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cell(h).%0A"><br>
To do this, we note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_u(g,%20%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cell(C_u%20g),%0A"> so for any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g"> we can find a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%20%5Cin%20B"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%20=%20C_ug"> and for such a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v(s)%20=%20u(s)%20+%20h(s)"> is absolutely continuous with respect to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)">.</p>
<p>This gives us our definition of the Cameron-Martin space (aka the RKHS) associated with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">.</p>

</div>
<p>A fun note is that the <em>reason</em> the probabilists don’t call the Cameron-Martin space the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is that there is no earthly reason to think that point evaluation will be bounded in general. So it become a problematique name. (And no, I don’t know why they’re ok with calling <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_u"> that some things are just mysterious.)</p>
<p><em>Lord in heaven. Any chance of being a bit more concrete?</em></p>
<p>Sure! Let’s consider the case where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En"> is a Gaussian random vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Au%20%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu,%20%5CSigma).%0A"> While all of this is horribly over-powered for this case, it does help get a grip on what the inner product on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_u"> is.</p>
<p>In this case, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%5E*"> is row vectors like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%5ET">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC_u(f%5ET,%20g%5ET)%20=%20%5Coperatorname%7BCov%7D(f%5ETu,%20g%5ETu)%20=%20f%5ET%5CSigma%20g.%0A"></p>
<p>Furthermore, <!-- the space $R_u$, which is generated by functionals of the form --> <!-- $(\ell - \mu(\ell))$, $\ell \in B^*$ now looks like^[] $ --> <!-- R_u = \{f^T: f^T\mu = 0} --> <!-- $ with the inner product $\langle f^T, g^T\rangle_{R_u} = f^T\Sigma g$. Finally, --> the operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_u%20=%20%5CSigma%20f"> satisfies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%5ET(%5CSigma%20f)%20=%20C_u(f%5ET,g%5ET)">.</p>
<p>So what is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_u">? Well, <em>every</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> dimensional vector space can be represented as an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-dimensional vector, so what we really need to do is identify <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%5E*"> from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h">. To do this, we use the relationship <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C(h%5E*,%20%5Cell)%20=%20%5Cell(h)"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Cin%20B%5E*">. Translating that to our finite dimensional case we get that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(h%5E*)%5ET%5CSigma%20g%20=%20h%5ET%20g,%5Cqquad%20g%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En,%0A"> from which it follows that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%5E*%20=%20%5CSigma%5E%7B-1%7Dh">. Hence we get the inner product between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h,%20k%20%5Cin%20H_u"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Clangle%20h,%20k%5Crangle_%7BH_u%7D%20&amp;=%20%5Clangle%20h%5E*,%20k%5E*%5Crangle_%7BR_h%7D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20(%5CSigma%5E%7B-1%7D%20h)%5ET%20%5CSigma%20(%5CSigma%5E%7B-1%20k%7D)%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20h%5ET%20%5CSigma%5E%7B-1%7D%20k.%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"></p>
<p><em>Ok! That’s cool!</em></p>
<p>Yes! And the same thing holds in general, if you squint<sup>49</sup>. Just replace the covariance matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma"> with the covariance operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(%5Cmathcal%7BC%7Df)(s)%20=%20%5Cint_S%20c(s,%20s')%20f(s')%20%5C,%20ds'.%0A"></p>
<p>This operator has (in a suitable sense) a symmetric<sup>50</sup> non-negative definite (left) (closed) inverse operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D">, which defines the RKHS inner product by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clangle%20f,%20g%20%5Crangle_%7BH_u%7D%20=%20%5Cint_%7BS%7D%20f(s)%20(%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D%20g)(s)%20%5C,ds,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g"> are smooth enough functions for this to make sense. In general, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D"> will be a (very) singular integral operator, but when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> has the Markov property, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D"> is a differential operator. In all of these cases the RKHS is the set of functions that are smooth enough that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clangle%20f,%20f%20%5Crangle_%7BH_u%7D%20%3C%20%5Cinfty">.</p>
<p>We sometimes call the operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BQ%7D"> the <em>precision operator</em> and it’s fundamental to thin plate spline theory as well as some nice ways to approximate GPs in 1-4 dimensions. I will blog about this later, probably, but for now if you’re interested <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01084">Finn Lindgren, Håvard Rue, and David Bolin just released a really nice survey paper about the technique</a>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tell-me-some-things-about-the-cameron-martin-space">Tell me some things about the Cameron-Martin space</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve gone to the effort of finding it, I should probably tell you why it’s so important. So here are a collection of facts!</p>
<p><strong>Fact 1:</strong> The Cameron-Martin space (the set of functions and the inner product) <em>determines</em> a<sup>51</sup> Gaussian process, in that if two Gaussian processes have the same mean and the the same Cameron-Martin space, they have the same distribution. In fact, the next definition of a Gaussian process is going to show this constructively.</p>
<p>This is nice because it means you can define a Gaussian process without needing to specify its covariance function. You just (just!) need to specify a Hilbert space. It turns out that this is a <em>considerably</em> easier task than trying to find a positive definite covariance function if the domain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> is weird.</p>
<p><strong>Fact 2:</strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> is <em>never</em> in the RKHS. That is, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20H_u)%20=%200">. But<sup>52</sup> if, for any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cepsilon%3E0">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%5Cepsilon%20%5Csubset%20B"> is any measurable set of functions with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A)%20=%20%5Cepsilon">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A_%5Cepsilon%20+%20H_u)%20=%201">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%5Cepsilon+H_u%20=%20%5C%7Ba%20+%20h%20%5Cin%20B:%20a%5Cin%20A_%5Cepsilon,%20h%20%5Cin%20H_u%5C%7D">. Or to say it in words, although <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is never in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_u">, if you find a set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%5Cepsilon"> that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> could be in (even if it’s extremely unlikely to be there), then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is almost surely made up of a function in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_%5Cepsilon"> plus a function in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_u">.</p>
<p>This is <em>wild</em>. It means that while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(%5Ccdot)"> is <em>never</em> in the RKHS, all you need to do is add a bit of rough to get all of the stuff out. Another characterisation of the RKHS that are related to this is that it is the intersection of all subsets of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> that have full measure under <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> (aka all sets <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%5Csubset%20B"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A)%20=%201">).</p>
<p><strong>Fact 3:</strong> If we observe some data <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%20N(Tu,%20%5CSigma_y)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Tu%20=%20(%5Cell_1(u),%5Cldots,%20%5Cell_n(u))%5ET"> is some observation vector, then the posterior mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(u%20%5Cmid%20y)"> is in the RKHS and that posterior distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%5Cmid%20y"> is a Gaussian process that’s absolutely continuous with respect to the prior GP u(s). This means that the posterior mean, which is our best point prediction under squared error loss, is <em>always</em> smoother than any of the posterior draws.</p>
<p>This kinda makes sense: averaging things <em>smooths out</em> the rough edges. And so when we average a Gaussian process in this way, we make it smoother. But this is a thing that we need to be aware of! Our algorithms, our reasoning for choosing a kernel, and our interpretations of the posterior <em>need</em> to be aware that the space of posterior realizations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> is rougher than the space that contains the posterior mean.</p>
<p>Frequentists / people who penalise likelihoods don’t have to worry about this shit.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-have-we-learnt">So what have we learnt?</h2>
<p>So so so so so so so much notation and weird maths shit.</p>
<p>But there are three take aways here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The importance of the Fourier transform (aka the characteristic function) when it comes to understanding Gaussian processes.</li>
<li>The maths buys us understanding of some of the more delicate properties of a Gaussian process as a random object (in particular it’s joint properties)</li>
<li>You can define a Gaussian process exclusively using the RKHS inner product. (You can also do all of the computations that way too, but we’ll cover that later). So you <em>do not need to explicitly specify a covariance function</em>. Grace Wahba started doing this with thin plate splines (and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L">-splines) in 1974 and it worked out pretty well for her.</li>
</ol>
<p>So to finish off this post, let’s show one more way of constructing a Gaussian process. This time we will <em>explicitly</em> start from the RKHS.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-gaussian-process-version-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-gaussian-process-version-3">What is a Gaussian process? (Version 3)</h2>
<p>Our final Gaussian process definition is going to centre the RKHS<sup>53</sup> as the <em>fundamental</em> object. This construction, which is known as an <em>abstract Wiener space<sup>54</sup></em> is less general<sup>55</sup> than our previous definition, but it covers most of the processes we are going to encounter in applications.</p>
<p>This construction is by far the most abstract of the three (it is in the name after all). So buckle up.</p>
<p>The jumping off point here is a separable Hilbert space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H">. This has an inner-product <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clangle%5Ccdot,%20%5Ccdot%20%5Crangle_H"> on it, and the associated notion of orthogonality and an orthogonal projector. Consider an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">-dimensional subspace <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_n%20%5Csubset%20H_u">. We can, without any trouble, define a Gaussian process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_n"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u_n"> with characteristic function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphi_%7B%5Ctilde%20u_n%7D(h)%20=%20%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clangle%20h,h%5Crangle_H%5Cright).%0A"> We hit no mathematical problems because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_n"> is finite dimensional and nothing weird happens to Gaussians in finite dimensions.</p>
<p>The thing is, we can do this for <em>any</em> finite dimensional subspace <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_n"> and, in particular, if we have a sequence of subspace <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_1%20%5Csubset%20V_2%20%5Csubset%20%5Cldots">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coperatorname%7Bdim%7D(V_n)%20=n">, then we can build a <em>sequence</em> of finite dimensional Gaussian processes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u_n"> that are each supported in their respective <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_n">.</p>
<p>The question is: can we construct a Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%7Bu%7D"> supported<sup>56</sup> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_n%20%5Ctilde%20u%20%5Cstackrel%7Bd%7D%7B=%7D%20%5Ctilde%20u_n">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_n"> is the orthogonal projector from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V_n">?</p>
<p>You would think the answer is yes. It is not. In fact, Komolgorov’s extension theorem says that we can build a Gaussian process this way, but it does not guarantee that the process will be supported on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H">. And it is not.</p>
<p>To see why this is, we need to look a bit more carefully at the covariance operator of a Gaussian process on a separable Hilbert space. The key mathematical feature of a separable Hilbert space is that it has an<sup>57</sup> orthonormal<sup>58</sup> basis <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_n">. We can use the orthonormal basis to do a tonne of things, but the one we need right now is the idea of a <em>trace</em><sup>59</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D(C_u)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bn%20=%201%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20C_u(e_i,%20e_i).%0A"></p>
<p>For a (zero mean) Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> supported on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H">, we can see that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7D%0A%5Coperatorname%7Btr%7D(C_u)%20&amp;=%20%5Csum_%7Bn%20=%201%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B(%5Clangle%20e_n,%20u%5Crangle)%5E2%5Cright%5D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B%20%5Csum_%7Bn%20=%201%7D%5E%5Cinfty%5Clangle%20e_n,%20u%5Crangle_H%5E2%5Cright%5D%20%5C%5C%0A&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Clangle%20u,%20u%5Crangle_H%5Cright%5D%20%3C%20%5Cinfty,%0A%5Cend%7Balign*%7D"> where the second line is just true because I say it is and the third line is Pythagoras’ theorem writ large (and is finite because Gaussian processes have a lot of moments<sup>60</sup>!).</p>
<p>If we were to say this in words, we would say that the covariance operator of a Gaussian process supported on a separable Hilbert space is a trace-class operator (or has a finite trace).</p>
<p>And this is where we rejoin the main narrative. You see, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%7Bu%7D"> was a stochastic process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H">, then its characteristic function would be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphi_%7B%5Ctilde%20u%7D(h)%20=%20%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clangle%20h,%20h%20%5Crangle_H%5Cright).%0A"> <em>But it can’t be</em>! Because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> is infinite dimensional and the proposed covariance operator is the identity on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H">, which is not trace class (its trace is clearly infinite).</p>
<p>So whatever <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u"> is<sup>61</sup>, it is emphatically <em>not</em> a Gaussian process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H">.</p>

<p>Well, while we did not successful make a Gaussian process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> we did actually build the guts of a Gaussian process on a different space. The trick is to use the same idea in reverse. We showed that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u"> was not a Gaussian process because its covariance operator wasn’t on trace class. It turns out that the reverse also holds: if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cphi_u(h)%20=%20%5Cexp%5Cleft(-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clangle%20C_uh,%20h%5Crangle_%7BH'%7D%5Cright)%0A"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_u"> is trace class on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is a Gaussian process supported on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'">.</p>
<p>The hard part is going to be finding another Hilbert space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'%20%5Csupset%20H">.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to recall a definition of a separable Hilbert space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> with orthonormal basis <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_n">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=1,%20%5Cldots,%20%5Cinfty">: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AH%20=%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20a_n%20e_n:%20%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20a_n%5E2%20%3C%20%5Cinfty%5Cright%5C%7D.%0A"> From this, we can build a larger separable Hilbert space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'"> as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AH'%20=%20%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20a_n%20e_n:%20%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Cfrac%7Ba_n%5E2%7D%7Bn%5E2%7D%20%3C%20%5Cinfty%5Cright%5C%7D.%0A"> This is larger because there are sequences of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_n">s that are admissible for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'"> that aren’t admissible for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> (for example<sup>62</sup>, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_n%20=%20%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D">).</p>
<p>We let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j:H%20%5Crightarrow%20H'"> be the linear embedding that we get by considering an element <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%20%5Cin%20H"> as an element of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'">. If we let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_n'"> be an orthonormal basis on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'"> (note: this is <em>not</em> the same as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_n"> as it needs to be re-scaled to have unit norm in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'">), then we get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aj%5Cleft(%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%5Calpha_n%20e_n%5Cright)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha_n%7D%7Bn%7D%20e_n'.%0A"> Why?

<p>With this machinery set up, we can ask if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u"> is a Gaussian process on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'">.

From this, and the reasoning in the previous section, we see that the Cameron-Martin space can be thought of as a subset of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'">. The Cameron-Martin inner product can be constructed from the inverse of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_u">, which gives <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clangle%20a,%20b%5Crangle_%7BH_u%7D%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20n%5E2%20a_n%20b_n.%0A"> Clearly, this will not be finite unless we put much much stronger restrictions on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_n"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b_n"> than that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bn%5Cgeq%201%7D%20n%5E%7B-2%7Da_n%5E2%20%3C%20%5Cinfty">.</p>
<p>The Cameron Marin space is the subspace of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'"> consisting of all functions <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h'%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20a_n%20e_n'"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20n%5E2a_n%5E2%20%3C%20%5Cinfty.%0A"> This is (isomorphic to) <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H">!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-you-actually-trying-to-kill-me">Are you actually trying to kill me?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So let’s recap what we just did: We took a separable Hilbert space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> and used it to construct a Gaussian process on a larger space <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H'"> with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> as its Cameron-Martin space. And we did all of this without ever touching a covariance function. This is an abstract Wiener space construction of a Gaussian process.</p>
<p>The thing is that this construction is <em>a lot</em> more general than this. The following is a (simplified<sup>64</sup>) version of the abstract Wiener space theorem.</p>
<div id="thm-cylindrical" class="theorem">
<p><span class="theorem-title"><strong>Theorem 3 </strong></span>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> be a separable Hilbert space and let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> be a separable Banach space. Furthermore, we assume that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> is dense in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">. Then there is a unique Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20B)%20=%201"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_u%20=%20H">. It can be constructed from the canonical cylindrical Gaussian process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u"> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H"> by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u%20=%20j(%5Ctilde%20u)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j:H%20%5Crightarrow%20E"> is the natural embedding.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="was-there-any-point-to-doing-that">Was there any point to doing that?</h3>
<p>I mean, probably not. The main thing we did here was see that you can take the RKHS as the primal object when building a Gaussian process. Why that may be a useful observation was not covered.</p>
<p>We also saw that there are some restrictions required on the covariance operator to ensure that a Gaussian process is a proper stochastic process on a given space. (For the tech-heads, the problem with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctilde%20u"> is that it’s associated probability measure is not countably additive. That is a bad thing, so we do not allow it.)<br>
</p>
<p>The restrictions are very clear for covariance operators on separable Hilbert spaces (they must be trace class). Unfortunately, there isn’t any clean characterization of all allowable covariance operators on more complex spaces like Banach spaces<sup>65</sup>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-do-we-go-now-but-nowhere">Where do we go now but nowhere</h2>
<p>And with that I have finished my task. I have defined Gaussian processes three different ways and if anyone is still reading at this point: you’re a fucking champion.</p>
<p>I probably want to talk about other stuff eventually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using all this technology to work out what happens to a posterior when we approximate a Gaussian process (which we usually do for computational reasons)</li>
<li>Understanding how singularity/absolute continuity of Gaussian measures can help you set priors for the parameters in a covariance function</li>
<li>The Markov property in space: what is it and how do you use it</li>
<li>Show how we can use methods for solving PDEs to approximate Gaussian processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one has gotten a lot less urgent because <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01084">Finn, David and Håvard just released a lovely survey paper</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe by the time I am finished with these things (if that ever happens, I don’t rate my chances), I will have justified all of this technicality. But for now, I am done.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>The first 5 chapters of <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-48116-6">Adler and Taylor’s masterpiece</a> s are glorious↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Not gonna lie. <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/surv-62">Bogachev’s Gaussian Measures</a> is only recommended if you believe in intercessory prayer.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Rozanov’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4613-8190-7">Markov Random Fields</a>, which is freely available from that link and is so beautiful you will cry when it turns the whole question into one about function space embeddings. It will be a moist old time. Bring tissues.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>I recommend some video head cleaner↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>which spent an embarrassing amount of time essentially divorced from the mainstream statistical literature↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>This is the nomenclature that machine learners thrust upon us and it’s annoying and I hate it. Traditionally, a stochastic process was indexed by time (so in this case it would be a one-dimensional Gaussian process and when it was indexed by any other set it was referred to as a <em>random field</em>. So I would much rather be talking about Gaussian random fields. Why? Because there’s a bunch of shit that is only true in 1D and I’m not interested in talking about that)↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Great book. Great reference. No shade whatsoever↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Maybe? But maybe I’m most interested in the average temperature over a region. This is why we are going to need to think about things more general than just evaluating Gaussian processes at a location.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Why the joint? Well because it’s likely that nearby temperature measurements will be similar, while measurements that are far apart are more likely to be (almost) independent (maybe after adjusting for season, time of day, etc).↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>in the sense that we have formulas for almost everything we want to have formulas for↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>We can also play games with multivariate Gaussians (like building deep Gaussian processes or putting stochastic models on the covariance structure) that markedly increase their flexibility.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Usually this involves covariates!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Wikipedia edit war aside (have a gander, it’s a blast), there’s evidence that Kolmogorov had a long-term relationship with Aleksandrov that was a) known at the time and b) used by the Soviets to blackmail them. So that’s fun.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>to be proper on some subspace. We are allowed zero eigenvalues for technical reasons and it actually turns out to be useful later, making things like thin plate splines a type of Gaussian process. Grace Wahba had to do all this without Google.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Exponential, Mat'{e}rn, and squared-exponential are the common ones on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed">. After that shit gets exotic.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>and any other process built from Kolmogorov’s extension theorem↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>so named because a set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20=%20%5C%7Bu(%5Ccdot):%20u(s_1,%20%5Cldots,%20u(s_K))%20%5Cin%20B;%5C;%20B%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%7BB%7D(%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EK)%5C%7D"> is called a <em>cylinder set</em>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>the exact definition is the smallest <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra for which all continuous linear functionals are measurable↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>The all part is important here. Consider the function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)%20=%201_%7BA%7D(s)"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is uniformly distributed on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1_A(s)"> is 1 when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s=A"> and zero otherwise. This function is equal to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> for almost every <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s"> (rather than for every <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s">), but the random function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> is definitely <em>not</em> the zero function (it is always non-zero at exactly one point).↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p><a href="http://www.hairer.org/notes/SPDEs.pdf">Bottom of page 12 through page 14 here</a>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>This is a straight generalisation. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_k(s)%20=%20%5Cdelta_%7Bs_k%7D(s)"> then it’s the exact situation we were in before.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>In the technical language of the next section, the set of delta functions is dense in the space of bounded linear functionals↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>aka replace integrals with sums, compute the joint distribution of the sums, and then send everything to infinity, which is ok when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell_k"> are bounded↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>The paper is pretty good and I think it’s a nice contribution. But the title was perfect.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>Sorry for the pay wall. It’s from so long ago it’s not on arXiv.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>Yes. NN-GPs, Vecchia approximations, fixed-rank Kriging, variational GPs, and all of the methods I haven’t specifically done work on, all abandon some or all of the covariance function. Whether the people who work on those methods think they’re abandoning the covariance function is between them an Cher.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>I say this, but you can make this work over pretty bonkers spaces. If we want to be general, if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E"> is a linear space and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F"> is a space of functionals on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E"> that separates the points of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u(s)"> is defined as a Gaussian process (wrt the appropriate cylindrical <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra) if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(u)"> is Gaussian for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%5Cin%20F">. Which is fairly general but also, like, at this point I am just really showing off my maths degree.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>It is very convenient that continuous linear functionals and bounded linear functionals are the same thing.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>it’s the one with a norm↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>The support of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u"> is a set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A%20%5Csubset%20B"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(u%20%5Cin%20A)%20=%201">.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>need is a big word here. We don’t need to do this, but not doing it makes things more technical. The assumption we are about to make let’s us breeze past a lot of edge cases as we sail from the unfettered Chapter 2 of Bogachev to the more staid and calm Chapter 3 of Bogachev.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>That it contains a countable dense set. Somewhat surprisingly, this implies that the Gaussian process is <em>separable</em> (or alternatively that it’s law is a Radon measure), which is a wildly technical condition that just makes everything about 80% less technical↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>There are separable spaces on the whole space too, but, like, leave me alone.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>I’ve made a↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>These sets don’t overlap, but they’re probably not very far apart from each other? Honestly I can’t be arsed checking but this is my feeling.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn41"><p>Everyone who’s ever suffered through that inexplicable grad-level measure-valued probability course that builds up this really fucking intense mathematical system and then essentially never uses it to do anything interesting should be well aware of the many many many many ways to prove the central limit theorem.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>well, the characteristic function when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t=1"> because if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cell%20%5Cin%20B%5E*">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t%5Cell%20%5Cin%20B%5E*">.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>In a locally convex space, this is true as measures over the cylindrical <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra, but for separable spaces it’s true over the Borel <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebra (aka all open sets), which is an enormous improvement. (This happens because for separable spaces these two <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">-algebras coincide.) That we have to make these sorts of distinctions (between Baire and Borel measures) at all is an important example of when you really need the measure theoretic machinery to do probability theory. Unfortunately, this is beyond the machinery that’s typically covered in that useless fucking grad probability course.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>It is not <em>at all</em> clear that the range of this operator is contained in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">. It should be mapping to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B%5E%7B**%7D">, but that separability really really helps! Check out the Hairer notes.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn46"><p>Radon-Nikodym derivative↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn47"><p>A true pain in the arse when working on infinite dimensional spaces is that there’s no natural equivalent of a Lebesgue measure, so we don’t have a universal default measure to take the density against. So we have to take it against an existing probability measure. In this case, the most convenient one is the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?u">. In finite dimensions, the density <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho(u)"> would satisfy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_w(x)%20=%20%5Crho(x)p_u(x)"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_w(%5Ccdot)"> is the density of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w">.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn53"><p>At some point while writing this I’ve started using RKHS and Cameron-Martin space interchangeably for the one that is a subset of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B">. We’re all just gonna have to be ok with that.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn55"><p>Although I made the big, ugly assumption that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?B"> was separable halfway through the last definition, almost everything is true without that.

<li id="fn59"><p>This is the trace of the operator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_u"> and I would usually write this as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bn%5Cgeq%201%7D%20%5Clangle%20Ce_i,%20e_i%5Crangle">, but it makes no difference here.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn60"><p>There’s a result called Fernique’s theorem that implies that Gaussian processes have all polynomial and exponential moments.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn61"><p>It’s called an iso-normal process and is <em>strongly</em> related to the idea of white noise and I’ll probably talk about that at some point.

<p>It is Friday night, I am in lockdown, and I have had a few drinks. So let’s talk about objective priors.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious thing is that they are not fucking objective. It is bad/unethical marketing from the 90s that has stuck. I dislike it. I think it’s unethical (and, personally, immoral) to proclaim a statistical method <em>objective</em> in any context, let alone one in which all you did was compute some derivatives and maybe sent something that isn’t going to fucking infinity to infinity. It’s fucking trash and I hate it.</p>
<p>But let’s talk about some objective priors.</p>
<section id="what-is-an-objective-prior" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-an-objective-prior">What is an objective prior</h3>

<p>No one (see above). But otherwise, a lot of people who are being sold a mislabeled bill of goods. People who tell you, unprompted, that they went to Duke.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-i-use-objective-priors">Should I use objective priors</h3>
<p>No.</p>
</section>
<section id="ok-lets-try-again." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ok-lets-try-again.">Ok let’s try again.</h2>
<p>No I do not think I will.</p>
<p>I am willing to talk about finite dimensional priors that add minimal information or are otherwise related to MLEs.</p>
<p>Later, I guess because I’m mathematically interested in it, I’ll talk about the infinite dimensional case. But not today. Because I’m pissed off.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<section id="what-is-an-objective-prior-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-an-objective-prior-1">What is an objective prior</h3>
<p>Honestly, still a pretty vague and stupid concept. It is difficult to define for interesting (aka not univariate) cases, but maybe the most practical definition is <em>priors that come from rules</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s not a … great definition. Many priors that I will talk about over the next little while could probably be shoved under the <em>objective</em> banner. But in this post I’m going to talk about the OG concept of an <em>objective</em> prior: the type of priors that try to add minimal information beyond the data.</p>
<p>Nominally, the aim of these priors is to <em>let the data speak for itself</em>. And I’ve been doing this a while, and no matter how long I’ve listened to my <code>.csv</code> file, it has never said a word. But if it weren’t for silly justifications, we wouldn’t have silly concepts.</p>
<p>There are, essentially, three main types of priors that fall into this traditionally <em>objective</em> category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeffreys priors</li>
<li>Reference priors</li>
<li>Matching priors</li>
</ul>
<p>Jefferys priors argue, for a bunch of very sensible and solid geometrical reasons, that the value of the parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> is less important than the way that moving from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta%20+%20d%5Ctheta"> will change the likelihood <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)">. This push back against the <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/08/21/against-arianism/">Arianist notion</a> that the prior can be separated from its context is welcome!</p>
<p>The actual prior itself comes from, I guess, the idea that the prior should be invariant to reparameterisations and after some maths you get <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Ctheta%20)%20%5Cpropto%20%7CI(%5Ctheta)%7C%5E%7B1/2%7D,%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7CI(%5Ctheta)%7C"> is the determinant of the Fisher<sup>1</sup> information matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AI(%5Ctheta)_%7Bij%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Ctheta_i%20%5Ctheta_j%7D%20%5Clog%20p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta).%0A"></p>
<p>This immediately turns out to be a terrible idea for general models. When <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> has more than one component, the Jeffreys prior tends to concentrate in silly places in the parameter space.</p>
<p>But when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> is one dimensional, it works fine. In fact, if you use it you will get the sampling distribution Maximum Likelihood estimator (or withing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D_p(n%5E%7B-1%7D)"> of it). So there’s very little purpose pursing this line of reasoning.</p>
<p>There’s actually a bit of a theme that develops here: for models with a single parameter a lot of things work perfectly. Sadly the intersection of one-dimensional statistical models that are regular enough for all this maths to work and interesting statistical problems is not exactly hefty.</p>
<p>Reference priors are an attempt to extend Jeffreys priors to multiple parameters while avoiding some of the more egregious problems of multivariate Jeffreys priors. They were also the topic of the most boring talk I have ever seen at a conference<sup>2</sup>. It was 45 minutes going through all of the different reference priors you can make for inferring a bivariate normal (you see, to construct a reference prior you need to order your parameters and this ordering matters). If I didn’t already think that reference priors were an impractical waste of time, that certainly convinced me. A lot of people seem to mention reference priors, but it is rarer to see them in use.</p>
<p>Matching priors try to spin off Jeffreys priors in a different direction. They are a mathematically very interesting idea asking if there is a prior that will produce a posterior uncertainty interval that is exactly the same as (or very close to) the sampling distribution of the MLE. It turns out that for one parameter models you can totally do this (the Jeffreys prior does it! And you can get even closer). But when there are nuisance parameters (aka parameters that aren’t of direct inferential interest but are important to modelling the data), the resulting prior tends to be data-dependent. A really nice example of the literature is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4356229">Reid, Mukerjee, and Fraser’s 2003 paper</a>. To some extent the matching priors literature is asking “should we even Bayes?”, which is not the worst question to ask<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>These three ideas have a number of weird bastard children. Most of these are not recommended by anyone, but used prominently. These are the vague priors. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(0,100%5E2)"> priors. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BInverse-Gamma%7D(%5Cepsilon,%20%5Cepsilon)"> priors. The Uniform over large interval priors. The misinformed concept behind these priors is that <em>wider prior = less information</em>. This is, of course, bullshit. As many<sup>4</sup> many<sup>5</sup> many<sup>6</sup> examples show.</p>
<p>The one big thing that I haven’t mentioned so far is that most of the time the priors produced using these methods are not proper, which is to say that you can’t integrate them. That isn’t a big deal mathematically as long as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cint_%5CTheta%20p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)p(%5Ctheta)%5C,d%5Ctheta"> is finite for all<sup>7</sup> data sets <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">. This is a fairly difficult thing to check for most models and if you want to really upset a grad student at a Bayesian conference spend some time staring at their poster and then grimace and ask “are you sure that posterior is proper?”<sup>8</sup> The frequent impropriety of these classes of means you can’t simulate from them, can’t really consider them a representation of prior information, and can’t easily transfer them from one problem to another without at least a little bit of fear that the whole house of cards is gonna come tumbling down.</p>
</section>
<section id="who-uses-objective-priors-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-uses-objective-priors-1">Who uses objective priors</h3>
<p>Frequentists. People who are obsessed with statistical bias of their estimators (the Venn diagram here isn’t a circle, but it’s also not the poster child for diversity of thought or modernity). People who read boring textbooks. People who write boring textbook. People who believe that it’s the choice of prior and somehow not the choice of the likelihood or, you know, their choice of data that will somehow lead to incorrect inferences<sup>9</sup>. People who tell you, without being asked<sup>10</sup>, that they went to Duke.</p>
</section>
<section id="should-i-use-objective-priors-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-i-use-objective-priors-1">Should I use objective priors</h3>
<p>If you’ve more parameters than a clumsy butcher has fingers on their non-dominant hand, you probably shouldn’t use objective priors. In these cases, you almost always need to inject some form of regularisation, prior information, or just plain hope into your model to make it behave sensibly<sup>11</sup>.</p>
<p>But if you have less, I mean, live your life I guess. But why go to the effort. Just compute a maximum likelihood if you’re looking for something that is very very similar to a maximum likelihood estimate. It’s faster, it’s cleaner, and it’s not pretending to be something it isn’t.</p>
<p>I actually think you can usually make stronger, more explicitly justified choices using other things we can talk about later. But I’m not the boss of statistics so you don’t have to listen to me.</p>

<p>If we’re going to talk about priors, let’s talk about priors. And let’s talk about the most prior-y priors in the whole damn prior universe. Let’s talk about <em>conjugate priors</em>.</p>

<section id="what-is-a-conjugate-prior-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-conjugate-prior-1">What is a conjugate prior?</h3>
<p>Conjugate priors are wild and fabulous beasts. They roam the strange, mathematic plains and live forever in our dreams of a better future.</p>
<p>Too much?</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Conjugate priors are a mathematical curiosity that occasional turn out to be slightly useful.</p>
<p>A prior distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta)"> is <em>conjugate</em> to the likelihood<sup>1</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)"> if the <em>posterior distribution</em> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta%20%5Cmid%20y)"> is in the same distributional family as the prior.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is an rule to update the parameters in the prior to get the parameters in the posterior based on some simple summaries of the data. This means that you can simply write the posterior down as a specific distribution that you can<sup>2</sup> easily sample from and get on with your life.</p>
<p>Really, it seems like a pretty good thing. But there is, unsurprisingly, a hitch: almost no likelihoods have conjugate priors. And if you happen to have a model with a nice<sup>3</sup> conjugate prior then good for you, but if you modify your model even slightly, you will no longer have one.</p>
<p>That is, the restriction to conjugate priors is a massive restriction on your <em>entire</em> model.</p>
</section>
<section id="who-uses-conjugate-priors-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-uses-conjugate-priors-1">Who uses conjugate priors?</h3>
<p>Conjugate priors are primarily used by two types of people:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>People who need to write exam questions for undergraduate Bayesian statistics courses<sup>4</sup>,</li>
<li>People who need to implement a Gibbs sampler and don’t want to live through the nightmare<sup>5</sup> that is Metropolis-within-Gibbs.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the most part, we can ignore the first group of people as a drain on society.</p>
<p>The second group is made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>people who are using software that forces it on them. And like we don’t all have time to learn new software<sup>6</sup>. Leave, as hero<sup>7</sup> Chris Crocker, Britney alone.</p></li>
<li><p>people who are writing their own Gibbs sampler. Annie Lennox said it best: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG7I4oniOyA">Why-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y?</a> For a very large variety of problems, <em>you do not have to do this</em><sup>8</sup>. The exception is when you have a discrete parameter in your model that you can’t marginalise out<sup>9</sup>, like an exponential random graph model or something equally hideous. Thankfully, a lot of work in machine learning has expanded the options for Bayesian and pseudo-semi-kinda Bayesian<sup>10</sup> estimation of these types of models. Anyway. Discrete parameters are disgusting. I am tremendously indiscrete.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third type are the odd ducks who insist that because the posterior and the prior being in the same family means that the prior can be interpreted as the outcome of Bayesian analysis on a previous experiment. Instead of the much more realistic way of arriving at a conjugate prior where you find yourself waking up alone in a bathtub full of ice and using an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BInverse-Gamma%7D(1/2,%200.0005)"> prior on the variance (which is conjugate for a Gaussian likelihood) because some paper from 1995<sup>11</sup> told you it was a good choice.</p>
</section>
<section id="should-i-use-conjugate-priors-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-i-use-conjugate-priors-1">Should I use conjugate priors?</h3>
<p>There is actually one situation where they can be pretty useful. If your parameter space breaks down into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta%20=%20(%5Ceta,%20%5Cphi)">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ceta"> is a high-dimensional variable, then if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)%20=%20p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ceta)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20%5Cphi)"> is conjugate for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ceta)">, then a <em>magical</em> thing happens: you can compute <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Cphi)"> explicitly (using the conjugate property) and then you can greatly simplify the posterior as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta%5Cmid%20y%20)%20=%20p(%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Cphi)%20p(%5Cphi%20%5Cmid%20y)">, where<sup>12</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ap(%5Cphi%20%5Cmid%20y)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bp(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ceta)p(%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20%5Cphi)p(%5Cphi)%7D%7Bp(y)%20p(%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Cphi)%7D%20%5Cpropto%20%5Cleft.%5Cfrac%7Bp(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ceta)p(%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20%5Cphi)p(%5Cphi)%7D%7Bp(%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20y,%20%5Cphi)%7D%5Cright%7C_%7B%5Ceta%20=%20%5Ctext%7Banything%7D%7D,%0A"> where every term on the right hand side is able to be calculated<sup>13</sup>. Even if this doesn’t have a known distribution form, it is much much lower-dimensional than the original problem and much more amenable to MCMC or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04468">possibly deterministic integration methods</a>.</p>
<p>This really does feel a bit abstract, so I will give you the one case where I know it’s used very commonly.This is the case where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20%5Csim%20N(A%5Ceta,%20R)"> and<sup>14</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ceta%20%5Cmid%20%5Cphi%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20%5CSigma(%5Cphi))">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma(%5Cphi)"> is a covariance matrix and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> is a matrix (the dimension of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ceta"> is often higher than the dimension of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y">).</p>
<p>This is an example of a class of models that occur <em>constantly</em> in statistics: Håvard Rue<sup>15</sup> calls them Latent Gaussian models. They basically extend<sup>16</sup> <code>(geostatistical)? linear|additive (mixed)? models</code>. So for all of these models, we can explicitly integrate out the high-dimensional Gaussian component, which makes inference <em>a breeze</em><sup>17</sup>.</p>
<p>It gets slightly better than that because if you combine this observation with a clever asymptotic approximation, you get an approximately conjugate model and can produce Laplace approximations, nested Laplace approximations<sup>18</sup>, and Integrated Nested Laplace approximations<sup>19</sup>, depending on how hard you are willing to work.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-conclusion-such-as-it-is" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-conclusion-such-as-it-is">A conclusion, such as it is</h3>
<p>Yes we have drifted somewhat from the topic, but that’s because the topic is boring.</p>
<p>Conjugate priors are mostly a mathematical curiosity and their role in Bayesian statistics is inexplicably inflated<sup>20</sup> to make them seem like a core topic. If you never learn about conjugate priors your Bayesian education will not be lacking anything. It will not meaningfully impact your practice. But even stopped clocks are right 2-3 times a day<sup>21</sup></p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I have feelings. Too many feelings. And ninety six point seven three percent of them are about prior distributions<sup>1</sup>. So I am going to write a few blog posts about prior distributions.</p>
<p>To be very honest, this is mostly a writing exercise<sup>2</sup> to get me out of a slump.</p>
<p>So let’s do this.</p>
<section id="no-love-deep-web" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="no-love-deep-web">No love, deep web</h2>
<p>As far as I am concerned it’s really fucking stupid to try to write about priors on their own. They are meaningless outside of their context. But, you know, this is a blog. So I get to be stupid.</p>
<p>So what is a prior distribution? It is whatever you want it to be. It is a probability distribution<sup>3</sup> that … I don’t know. Exists<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Ok. This is not going well. Let’s try again.</p>
<p>A prior distribution is, most of the time, a probability distribution on the parameters of a statistical model. For all practical purposes, we tend to work with its density, so if the parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta">, which could be a scalar but, in any interesting case, isn’t, has prior <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(%5Ctheta)">.</p>
</section>
<section id="captain-fantastic-and-the-brown-dirt-cowboy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="captain-fantastic-and-the-brown-dirt-cowboy">Captain fantastic and the brown dirt cowboy</h2>
<p>But what does it all meeeeeeeean?</p>
<p>We have a prior distribution specified, gloriously, by it’s density. And unlike destiny, density is meaningless. It only makes sense when we integrate it up to get a probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5CPr(A)%20=%20%5Cint_A%20p(%5Ctheta)%5C,d%5Ctheta.%0A"></p>
<p>So what does the prior probabilty <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPr(A)"> of a set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> actually mean in real life? The answer may shock you: it means something between nothing and everything.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Let’s imagine that we were trying to estimate the probability that someone in some relative homogeneous subgroup of customers completed a purchase on our website. It’s a binary process, so the parameter of interest can probably just be the probability that a sale is made. While we don’t know what the probability of a sale is for the subgroup of interest, we know a lot sales on our website in general (in particular, we know that about 3% of visits result in sales). So if I also believe that it would be wildly unlikely for 20% of visits to result in a sale, I could posit a prior like a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BBeta%7D(0.4,5)"> prior that captures (a version of) these two pieces of information.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Let’s imagine I want to do variable selection. I don’t know why. I was just told I want to do variable selection. So I fire up the <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2017/11/02/king-must-die/">Bayesian Lasso</a><sup>5</sup> and then threshold in some way. In this case, the prior encode a hoped-for property of my posterior. (To paraphrase Lana, hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like you to have because the Bayeisan Lasso does not work to the point that the original paper doesn’t even suggest using it for variable selection<sup>6</sup> it just, idk, liked the name. Statistics is wild.)</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> I’m doing a regression with just one variable (because why not) and I think that the relationship between the response <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> and the covariate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> is non-linear. That is, I think there is some unknown to me function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x)"> such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(y_i)%20=%20f(x_i)">. So I ask a friend and they tell me to use a Gaussian Process prior for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(%5Ccdot)"> with an exponential covariance function.</p>
<p>While I can write down the density for the joint prior of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(f(x_1),%20f(x_2,),%20%5Cldots,%20f(x_n))">, I do not know<sup>7</sup> what this prior means in any substantive sense. But I can tell you, you’re gonna need that maths degree to even try.</p>
<p>And should you look deeper, you will find more and more scenarios where priors are doing different things for different reasons<sup>8</sup>. For each of these priors in each of these scenarios, we will be able to compute the posterior (or a reasonable computational approximation to it) and then work with that posterior to answer our questions.</p>
<p>Different people<sup>9</sup> will use priors different ways even for very similar problems<sup>10</sup>. This remains true even though they are nominally working under the same inferential framework.</p>
<p><em>Bayesians are chaotic.</em></p>

<section id="mapping-out-a-sky-what-you-feel-like-planning-a-sky" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mapping-out-a-sky-what-you-feel-like-planning-a-sky">Mapping out a sky / What you feel like, planning a sky</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ducG55pfCMQ">Sondheim’s ode to pointillism</a> feels relevant here. The reality of the prior distribution—and the whole reason the concept is so slippery and chaotic—is that you are, dot by dot, constructing the world of your inference. This act of construction is fundamental to understanding how Bayesian methods work, how to justify your choices, and how to use a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808">Bayesian workflow</a> to solve complex problems.</p>
<p>To torture the metaphor, our prior distribution is just our paint, unmixed, slowly congealing, possibly made of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy_brown">ground up mummys</a>. It is nothing without a painter and a brush.</p>
<p>The painter is the likelihood or, more generally, the generative link between the parameter values and the actual data, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p(y%20%5Cmid%20%5Ctheta)">. The brush is the computational engine you use to actually produce the posterior painting<sup>11</sup>.</p>
<p>This then speaks to the core challenge with writing about priors: it depends on how you use them. It is a fallacy, or perhaps a foolishness, or perhaps a heresy<sup>12</sup>. Hell, when trying to understand a single inference <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/10/555">The Prior Can Only Be Understood In The Context Of The Likelihood</a><sup>13</sup>. In the context of an entire <em>workflow</em>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-019-00051-0">The Experiment is just as Important as the Likelihood in Understanding the Prior</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, using independent Cauchy priors for the coefficients in a linear regression model will result in a perfectly ok posterior. Whereas the same priors used in a logistic regression, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-13/issue-2/On-the-Use-of-Cauchy-Prior-Distributions-for-Bayesian-Logistic/10.1214/17-BA1051.full">you may end up with posteriors with such heavy tails that they don’t have a mean</a>! (Do we care? Well, yes. If we want reasonable uncertainty intervals we probably want 2 or so moments otherwise those large deviations are gonna getcha!)</p>
</section>
<section id="so-what" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>All of this is fascinating. And it is a lot less chaotic than it initially sounds.</p>
<p>The reality is that while two Bayesians may use different priors and, hence, produce different posteriors for the same data set.This can be extreme. For example, if I am trying to estimate the mean of data generated by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i%20%5Csim%20N(%5Cmu,%201)">, then I can choose a prior<sup>14</sup> (that depends on the data) so that the posterior mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(%5Cmu%20%5Cmid%20y)%20=1">. Or, to put it differently, I can get any answer I want if I choose an prior carefully (and in a data-dependent manner).</p>
<p>But this isn’t necessarily a problem. This is because the posteriors produced by two <em>sensible</em> priors for the same problem will produce fairly similar results<sup>15</sup>. The prior I used to cheat in the previous example would not be considered sensible by anyone looking at it<sup>16</sup>.</p>
<p>But what is a sensible prior? Can you tell if a prior is sensible or not in its particular context? Well honey, how long have you got. The thing about starting a (potential) series of blog posts is that I don’t really know how far I’m going to get, but I would really like to talk a lot about that over the next little while.</p>

<p>I’ve been teaching a lot lately. That’s no huge surprise. It is my job. Maybe the one slight oddity this year is that I shifted jobs and, in switching hemispheres, I landed 3 consecutive teaching semesters. So. I’ve been teaching a lot lately.</p>
<p>And when you’re in a period of heavy teaching, every-fucking-thing is about teaching.</p>
<p>So this blogpost is about teaching.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m coming to the end of a second year class called <em>Statistical Thinking</em>. It’s been fun to work out how to teach the material. It’s standard fare: sampling variation, tests, bootstraps<sup>1</sup>, regression, and just a hint of Bayes in the last 2 weeks that you incentivize by promising a bastard of an exam question. So you know, (arms up even though I’m Catholic) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nwj8nAYEM4"><strong>tradition</strong></a>!</p>
<section id="if-i-were-a-rich-man-katrina-lenk-with-a-violin" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="if-i-were-a-rich-man-katrina-lenk-with-a-violin">If I were a rich man (Katrina Lenk with a violin)</h3>
<p>The thing about teaching an intro stats class is that it brings screaming to mind that quote from Bennett’s The History Boys<sup>2</sup>: (paraphrasing) <em>“How do I define [intro to Statistics]? It’s just one fucking thing after another”</em>.</p>
<p>Constructing twelve moderately sequential weeks from the whole mass of things that someone being introduced to statistics needs to know is not unlike being thrown in the middle of the lake with nothing but an ice-cream container and a desiccated whale penis: confusing, difficult, and rather damp.</p>
<p>The nice thing about building an intro stats course is you’re not alone. You’re adrift in a sea of shit ideas! (Also a lot of good ones<sup>3</sup>, but don’t ruin my flow!)</p>
<p>The trouble is that this sort of course is simultaneously teaching <em>big concepts</em> and <em>complex details</em>. And while it’s not toooooo hard to make the concepts build and reinforce as time inexorably marches on, the techniques and details needed to illuminate the big concepts are not quite as linear.</p>
<p>There are two routes through this conundrum: incantations inscribed onto books made of human skin using the blood of sacrificial virgins (aka gathered during engineering statistics service teaching) or computers.</p>
<p>I went with computers because we are in lockdown and I couldn’t be bothered sourcing and bleeding virgins.</p>
<p>The downside is that you need the students to have a grip on R programming (and programmatic thinking). This only happens if the degree you are teaching in is built in such a way that these skills have already been taught. Otherwise you need to teach both (which is very possible, but you need to teach less statistical content).</p>
<p>This is not a postmortem on my teaching, but if it were, it would be about that last point.</p>

<p>Because I’m thinking about this stuff pretty hard right now, I am (as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x31XrfiikwQ">Hedwig</a> would say) fully dilated.</p>
<p>And my question is <em>what is the use of teaching this distinction?</em> Should anyone bother dividing by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(n-1)"> instead of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> in their variance estimates?</p>

<p>Well that is clear. There is not.</p>
<p>Or, well, there is a <em>small</em> difference.</p>
<p>But to see it, you need a lot of samples! Why? Well the easy answer is maths.</p>
<p>For one thing, when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=10">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn-1%7D%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B90%7D%20=%200.01.%0A"> This does not compare well against the sampling variance, which (assuming <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2%5Capprox%201">, which is usual if you’ve scaled your problem correctly) is about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.3">.</p>
<p>But we could choose to do it properly. The bias in the MLE (aka the divide by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">) variance estimate is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A-%5Cfrac%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D%7Bn%7D.%0A"> This is a lot smaller than the sampling variability of the estimate (aka how much uncertainty you have because of the finite sample), which is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cfrac%7B%5Csigma%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>And that’s the whole story. Dividing by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> instead of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(n-1)"> leaves you with a <em>slightly</em> biased estimate. But the bias if <em>fucking tiny</em>. It is possibly moving your second decimal place by about 1 number (assume our population variance is one). The sampling variably is moving the <em>first</em> decimal place by several digits.</p>
<p>Truly. What is the point. The old guys<sup>4</sup> who went wild about bias are now mostly dead. Or they’ve changed their minds (which is, you know, a reasonable thing to do as information about best practice is updated). The war against bias was lost before your undergraduates were born.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="even-in-crisis-i-maintain">Even in crisis, I maintain</h3>
<p>But nevertheless, this whole DIVIDE BY N-1 OR THE BIAS MONSTER IS GONNA GET YA bullshit continues.</p>
<p>And to some extent, maybe I shouldn’t care. I definitely shouldn’t care this many words about it.</p>
<p>But I do. And I do for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Reason One:</strong> What is the point teaching students about uncertainty and that you can’t just say “this number is different” because the estimate on a single sample is different. If I am to say that I need things to be <em>at least</em><sup>5</sup> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D(n%5E%7B-1/2%7D)"> apart before I’m willing to say they are maybe different, then why am I harping on about the much smaller difference?</p>
<p><strong>Reason Two:</strong> It’s a shitty example. Bias and bias corrections have a role to play in statistics<sup>6</sup>. But if this is your first introduction to bias correction, you are going to teach either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Bias is always bad, regardless of context / sampling variance / etc</li>
<li>Bias can be corrected, but it’s trivial and small.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of those things are bullshit. Just teach them how to bootstrap and teach the damn thing properly. You do not have to go very far to show bias actually making a difference!</p>
<p><em>Maybe</em> the only place the difference will be noticed is if you compare against the in-build <code>var</code> or <code>sd</code> functions. This is not the use case I would build my class around, but it is a thing you would need to be aware of.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-worlds-is-a-question-this-room-is-an-answer.-and-the-answer-is-no.">The worlds is a question, this room is an answer. And the answer is no.</h3>
<p>If you are going to teach statistics as more than just stale incantations and over-done fear-mongering, you need to construct the types of stakes that are simply not present in the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> vs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n-1"> bullshit.</p>
<p>It is present when you are teaching the normal vs t distribution. You are teaching that the design of your experiment changes the possible extreme behaviour and sometimes it can change <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<p>The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> vs <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(n-1)"> denominator for a variance estimator is a curiosity. It is the source of thrilling<sup>7</sup> exercises or exam questions. But it is not interesting.</p>
<p>It could maybe set up the idea that MLEs are not unbiased. But even then, the useless correction term is not needed. Just let it be slightly biased and move on with your life.</p>
<p>Because if that is the biggest bias in your analysis, you are truly blessed.</p>
<p>In real life, bias is the price you pay for being good at statistics. And like any market, if you pay too much you’re maybe not that good. But if you pay nothing at all, you don’t get to play.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>To paraphrase Jimmy Somerville, tell me <em>whyyyyyyyyy</em> about 90% of the bootstrap material on the web is … misguided. And why <code>tidymodels</code> only has the shit bootstrap in it?↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Ok. Straight up, <em>“[Intro to statistics] is a commentary on the various and continuing incapabilities of men”</em> would’ve also worked.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This course stands on the shoulders of giants: Di Cook and Catherine Forbes gave me a great base. And of course every single textbook (shout out to the OpenIntro crew!), blog post, weird subsection of some other book, paper from 1987 on some weird bootstrap, etc that I have used to make a course!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Yes. I used the word on purpose.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> is the size of the sample.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>I spend most of my time doing Bayes shit, and we play this game somewhat differently. But the gist is the same.↩︎</p></li>
